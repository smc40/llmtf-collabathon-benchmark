      "full_text": "The scope of this Inquiry has been exceptionally wide in four particular ways: (1) the scale of the harm: the number of those infected amounts to tens of thousands, many of whom have died (and continue to die); (2) the geographical scope, encompassing as it does all four nations within the United Kingdom; (3) the timeframe: since the NHS began, exploring over five decades of decisionmaking, action and inaction; (4) the remit, which has been to examine not only the events which caused or contributed to the infection of so many people (“what happened and why”?) but also the response of government, the NHS and others in the decades following the transmission of infection, and how that response has compounded the harms already inflicted. I shall say a little more in this Introduction about each of these aspects. As to scale, more than 3,000 deaths are attributable to infected blood and blood products. Around 380 children with bleeding disorders were infected with HIV, a third of the 1,250 people with bleeding disorders infected with HIV, with the majority also being coinfected with Hepatitis C and some with Hepatitis B and other infections as well. Three quarters of those with bleeding disorders who were infected with HIV have died. Between 80 and possibly up to about 100 people were infected with HIV through transfusions. About 85% of those have died. Around 26,800 people were infected with Hepatitis C through blood transfusions between 1970 and 1991, of whom about 22,000 were chronically infected beyond the initial six months, with 2,700 surviving to the end of 2019. Between 2,400 and 5,000 people with bleeding disorders were infected with Hepatitis C without being infected with HIV, but sometimes with Hepatitis B and other infections as well. There is insufficient evidence to estimate the numbers of people infected with Hepatitis B through blood and blood products. There were five recorded cases of confirmed or probable blood-borne variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (“vCJD”) infections. Three were symptomatic and all have died. It is important not to lose sight of the fact that behind those statistics are individuals, each with a story of suffering and loss that is personal to them. People infected and affected have told powerful stories of pain, sickness and loss, of lives damaged and destroyed, unrecognisable from before their infection and unrecognisable from all their hopes and dreams for their lives. Each person who has felt able to give evidence and each person who has supported them and continues to provide support and solidarity through the ongoing suffering and loss deserves respect. This account builds on their accounts, taken together with the evidence and input of all others who have participated in this Inquiry: participants not only in name but in a collective endeavour. As to geographical remit, this Inquiry has sought to examine, as far as possible, relevant decision-making in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is right to note, however, that many of the decisions and actions which this Report examines were taken in Westminster, by the UK government. The available evidence suggests that for the most part, and certainly in the period prior to legislative and executive devolution, Wales and Northern Ireland (and to a lesser extent Scotland) followed the path charted by the Department of Health.3  That is inevitably reflected in the focus of some of the chapters in this Report. The timeframe examined by this Report is extensive, covering over five decades of decisionmaking.4  That has brought with it additional challenges, as has the fact that an inquiry did not take place at a much earlier stage.5  Documents that existed years ago no longer exist.6 There are individuals, from government, from the medical profession, from pharmaceutical companies and elsewhere, who played an important part in events, from whom the Inquiry has been unable to hear, either because they are dead or because of impairments of health or age. Some of those who did give evidence had little independent memory of events, save to the extent that they were prompted by contemporaneous documents. Notwithstanding these challenges it has been possible in this Report to reach conclusions on the central questions raised by the Inquiry’s Terms of Reference. The broad remit of the Inquiry is reflected in the structure of this Report. The Report begins with an examination of impact, through a narrative of the experiences of people who were infected and affected,7  and with an analysis of events at Treloar’s, which both illustrates and highlights the nature of, and many of the reasons for, the national treatment disaster which was infected blood.8  The Report then looks at the question of “What happened and why?”. through an examination of the actions and inactions of governments,9  the blood transfusion services,10 haemophilia centres and their directors,11 and pharmaceutical companies,12 and an examination of transfusion practices.13 It considers specific areas where opportunities to reduce risk were missed, such as the failure to achieve self-sufficiency in England and Wales,14 the failure to introduce surrogate screening for either HIV or Hepatitis C,15 and the delays in introducing screening for HIV and for Hepatitis C.16 The Report then turns to consider how governments, the NHS and others responded to the infections of so many people. Amongst other matters it looks at the refusal over decades to provide compensation and the decision-making that led (after delays) to agreements in principle to establish ex gratia payment schemes;17 the ways in which those schemes (the Alliance House Organisations) operated and their replacement with national support schemes;18 difficulties in accessing appropriate treatment and care;19 problems created by missing or incomplete or inaccurate medical records;20 and the defensiveness of government, through its publication of a self-sufficiency chronology, its repeated use of indefensible lines to take and its refusal over decades to hold a public inquiry.21 The picture that emerges overall from the findings in this Report is one in which people have been failed, not once but repeatedly, by their doctors, by the bodies (NHS and other) responsible for the safety of their treatment, and by their governments. Six particular themes are prominent. The first is the failure to make patient safety the paramount focus of decision-making and of action – whether it be decisions by individual clinicians, haemophilia centres or hospitals, or decisions taken at a regional level by transfusion centres, or decisions taken at a national level by governments. The second theme is the slow and protracted nature of much of the decision-making examined in this Report: by way of example, the length of time taken for haemophilia centres to adapt treatment policies and practices, or the length of time taken by clinicians and NHS organisations to recognise the need for better transfusion practice, or the delays with regard to AIDS donor leaflets, or the delayed decision-making by government regarding the introduction of Hepatitis C screening of blood donations and the delay in deciding to undertake a lookback.The third is the profoundly unethical lack of respect for individual patient autonomy, which will be most starkly apparent to readers from the chapters on People’s Experiences and Treloar’s and from parts of the chapters on Haemophilia Centres: Policies and Practice and Blood Transfusion: Clinical Practice. The fourth theme, closely related to the third, speaks of the dangers of clinical freedom. Clinical freedom is the idea that doctors should be free to do what they believe to be right for an individual patient. But the danger of clinical freedom in the context of infected blood and blood products is that it allowed doctors to follow unsafe treatment policies and practices (such as administering commercial factor concentrates to young children, or giving unnecessary transfusions to postpartum women), and it meant that others (in particular the health departments and Chief Medical Officers) held back from providing advice, guidance or information in the misguided belief that this would interfere with clinical freedom. The fifth theme is that of institutional defensiveness, from the NHS and in particular from government, compounded by groupthink amongst civil servants and ministers, and a lack of transparency and candour. These factors drove the response of government over the decades. The institutional defensiveness identified above is damaging to the public interest. But the sixth principal theme that emerges from this Report is the damage that was done by that defensiveness and the accompanying lack of transparency and candour to the very people whose lives had been destroyed by infection. The harms already done to them were compounded by the refusal to accept responsibility and offer accountability, the refusal to give the answers that people fervently sought, the refusal to provide compensation, leaving people struggling and in desperate circumstances, the thoughtless repetition of unjustified and misleading lines to take, and the lack of any real recognition and of any meaningful apology. The purpose of this Overview is to provide a chapter-by-chapter summary to help readers navigate the Report.22 Some chapters lend themselves relatively easily to a neat summary; others tell a more multifactorial story, sometimes spanning decades, and are harder to compress. The summaries below are not intended as a substitute for reading the individual chapters, but will perhaps help readers to identify the chapters that are of the most importance or relevance to them. Where conclusions are expressed in a chapter they may be more nuanced than appears from the short summary given here, and the context against which they are drawn should be read if the conclusions are to be fully appreciated. In the course of some of the Overview, abbreviations or acronyms are used: such as UKHCDO (UK Haemophilia Centre Directors’ Organisation) or ACVSB (Advisory Committee on the Virological Safety of Blood). They are explained when they first appear in the text and used for brevity thereafter – but a glossary and brief chronology come at the end, for ease of reference.",
        
       "summary": "Patients have received blood or blood products from the NHS since it began in 1948. Many of those treated with them, particularly between 1970 and 1998, died or suffered miserably, and many continue to suffer. This was not as a direct result of the underlying condition or illness that took them to the NHS in the first place, but as a result of the treatment itself. This would be catastrophic enough if they were the only victims. But the treatment has caused others to suffer too – partners, family, children, friends – some by being themselves infected, some by having to watch loved ones die, some by having to give their lives to caring; and almost every one of them, infected and affected, suffering in almost every aspect of their lives. I have to report a catalogue of failures which caused this to happen. Each on its own is serious. Taken together they are a calamity. Lord Winston famously called these events “the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS”. I have to report that it could largely, though not entirely, have been avoided. And I have to report that it should have been. I have also to report systemic, collective and individual failures to deal ethically, appropriately, and quickly, with the risk of infections being transmitted in blood, with the infections when the risk materialised, and with the consequences for thousands of families. There were around 4,000 to 6,000 people with bleeding disorders in the UK at any one time. Around 1,250 were infected with HIV. The best estimate is that this included 380 children. Almost all infected with HIV were also infected with Hepatitis C and some with Hepatitis B and Hepatitis D as well. Three quarters of these 1,250 adults and children have died. A larger number still (between 2,400 and 5,000 people with bleeding disorders) who were not infected by HIV received blood products infected with one or more hepatitis viruses, and developed chronic Hepatitis C. People who were infected by transfusions, rather than by blood products, were infected in even greater numbers. Between 80 and 100 were infected with HIV after a blood transfusion. Approximately 26,800 were infected with Hepatitis C after a blood transfusion, often linked with childbirth or surgery, but also from transfusions to treat thalassemia, sickle disease, or leukaemia, or tissue transfer. It has not been possible to estimate the number of people infected with chronic Hepatitis B due to limited data. A significant number of people who received blood products and some who received blood transfusions have since been told that they are at an increased risk of vCJD, and should alert their medical practitioner or dentist prior to treatment. This in turn has compromised their access to that treatment. The scale of what happened is horrifying. The most accurate estimate is that more than 3,000 deaths are attributable to infected blood, blood products and tissue. To understand the failings, it is necessary to set out the reasoning behind my conclusions in some detail. They need to be explained and set in context. That will follow in the chapters of this Report. What follows makes for hard reading. For now, though, the headline points are these: The principal infections considered by the Inquiry are Hepatitis (B and C) and HIV. The transmission of vCJD is also considered. It was well known from at least the early 1940s, and became clear beyond doubt in the mid1940s, that blood transfusions or the use of plasma could transmit “serum hepatitis”. It was known that this could be fatal, or lead to serious long-term disease, liver failure, cirrhosis and cancer. The virus responsible for Hepatitis B was identified by the early 1970s. The virus responsible for Hepatitis C was not identified until 1988, but it was apparent at least from the mid 1970s that non-A non-B Hepatitis (as it was known prior to 1988) was responsible for the majority of post-transfusion hepatitis cases and that just as Hepatitis B could have serious long-term consequences, so too might non-A non-B Hepatitis. Awareness of AIDS began in 1981, and it was apparent by mid 1982 that whatever was causing AIDS might be transmissible by blood and blood products.",
