The total tralokinumab exposure in these studies corresponded to\napproximately 1,404 patient-years, of which about 900 patient-years were directly placebo-controlled.\nPlacebo exposure equalled a total of 273 patient-years.\nThe exposure in the entire submitted clinical development of tralokinumab, including all investigated\napplications, was 3,054 patient-years, with a total of 4,281 exposed patients.\nAdverse events\nDeaths: In the placebo-controlled trials, a total of 2/1,605 deaths occurred with tralokinumab in\npatients with atopic dermatitis versus 0/680 with placebo. A causal relationship with the study\nmedication is unlikely in either case.\nTEAE frequency and pattern: Mild drug-related TEAEs were numerically more frequent with\ntralokinumab compared with placebo, whereas more severe TEAEs were less frequent. Compared to\nplacebo, local reactions, conjunctivitis (rarely also keratitis), upper respiratory tract infections and\nherpes simplex, headache and blood eosinophilia were more frequent.\nAntibodies: Antibodies to tralokinumab (ADAs) were evaluated in all clinical trials. ADAs were present\nin 4.4% of patients treated with tralokinumab and in 1.4% of tralokinumab-na\u00efve patients. Neutralising\nantibodies were observed in 0.9% and 0.5% of patients, respectively. An analysis of patients with\nADAs and their incidence/pattern of TEAEs does not indicate a signal.\nLaboratory changes: There was a slight increase in blood eosinophilia with tralokinumab treatment,\nbut this was usually asymptomatic.\nIn conclusion, mild TEAEs were slightly more frequent with tralokinumab than with placebo. The\ndifferences were mainly due to local reactions conjunctivitis/keratitis, herpes, viral infections and mild\nblood eosinophilia.\nThe experience to date is too limited to make reliable statements about rare but potentially prohibitive\nadverse drug reactions. Some theoretical risks of this antibody are listed below (not exhaustive):\n\u2212 Tralokinumab is an IgG4 antibody and based on the dose recommendation requested, preexisting IgG4 levels can be expected to double on average with treatment. IgG4 is quantitatively\nthe smallest immunoglobulin subclass. With large interindividual differences (0.01-1.4mg/mL) but\nindividually constant values, it amounts to only about 5% of the total immunoglobulins. Its function\nis unclear. The consequences of a permanent increase cannot be estimated at the present state\nof knowledge.\n\u2212 Malignancy: The exact significance of IL-13, especially for tumour defence, is not known. Due to\nthe relatively short treatment/observation period, the data presented leave the possibility of\nunfavourable long-term effects in this regard.",

Furthermore, the filling volume was also higher for QIV-HD compared to\nTIV-HD. For the listed reasons, with the exception of the post-marketing data of TIV-HD, the safety\nprofile needed to be characterised based on QIV-HD specific data.\nThe additionally requested Study QHD00011 submitted to Swissmedic with the answer to the\nPreliminary Decision compared the QIV-HD to a standard-dose QIV and provided relevant further\ninformation on the safety profile of the vaccine.\nStudy QHD00013\nAll subjects were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and any unsolicited systemic AEs\noccurring during that time were recorded as immediate unsolicited systemic AEs. Solicited reactions\nwere collected for 7 days after vaccination, and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were collected up to\nDay 28. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were collected\nup to Day 180 following vaccination.\nSafety results were analysed descriptively for subjects in the safety analysis set (SafAS) who received\nQIV-HD, TIV-HD1, and TIV-HD2. Solicited reactions (solicited injection site and systemic reactions),\nunsolicited AEs, SAEs, and AESIs were summarised.\nVery few subjects were discontinued from the study.\nWithin 7 days after vaccination, the percentages of subjects who reported at least 1 solicited injection\nsite reaction were 44.1% (779/1,768) and 39.8% (354/889) in the QIV-HD and TIV-HD pooled groups,\nrespectively. The most frequently reported solicited injection site reaction was pain, reported by\n41.3% in the QIV-HD and 36.4% and TIV-HD pooled groups.\nAlthough the percentage of subjects who reported at least one solicited reaction within 7 days after\nvaccination were similar between groups, Grade 2 and Grade 3 reactions were reported more often in\nthe QIV-HD group.\nThe few Grade 3 solicited injection site reactions were reported by 26 (1.5%) and 4 (0.4%) subjects in\nthe QIV-HD and TIV-HD pooled groups, and the reactions were pain 12 (0.7%) vs 2 (0.2%), erythema\n11 (0.6%) vs 2 (0.2%), swelling 5 (0.3%) vs 1 (0.1%) and induration 3 (0.2%) vs 1 (0.1%).\nThis slightly greater reactogenicity is most likely due to the higher HA (and other non-HA protein)\ncontent in the QIV-HD vs TIV-HD.\nThe most frequently reported solicited systemic reaction was myalgia, reported by 22.7% and 18.9%\nof subjects in the QIV-HD and TIV-HD pooled groups, respectively.\nThe percentages of SAEs and deaths in the study groups were similar. A total of 128 subjects\nexperienced 162 SAEs during the study.\nOne subject in the QIV-HD group developed small fibre inflammatory neuropathy 40 days after the\nvaccination. This was considered by the investigator to be related to the study vaccination, but was\nconsidered by the sponsor to be not related to the study vaccination since the event occurred more\nthan 1 month after vaccination (outside of the usual time window for the vast majority of vaccinerelated events) and in view of the other aetiologies reported (i.e., vitamin B12 deficiency and recent\nviral illness), which are more likely causes of the SAE.\nHowever, a causal relation to the vaccination cannot be ruled out.\nA total of 5 deaths were reported during the study. Two within 28 days: one in the QIV-HD group, 6\ndays after vaccination, reported as due to natural causes, although the subject was suspected to have\nMI, arrhythmia, or massive stroke; the second in the TIV-HD1 group 25 days after vaccination and\nassociated with myocardial infarction.

On day 34 he was admitted to hospital for a syncopal episode and cough. He was\ndiagnosed with pneumonia and was discharged 2 days later on antibiotics. On day 87 pneumonia and\nsepsis were diagnosed in the hospital and he died 19 days later.\nAll deaths and AESIs were evaluated as unrelated to the study vaccination. Reported AESIs were few\nand distributed across the groups, although all (3) involved Bell\u2019s palsy. Bell\u2019s palsy is included in the\ndraft information for professional healthcare as a post-marketing AE of the trivalent vaccine.\nIn summary, in Study QHD00013 no new safety concerns were identified in QIV-HD versus TIV-HD,\nalthough a slightly greater reactogenicity was observed for the QIV-HD compared to the TIV-HD,\nwhich could be explained by the higher amount of HA and impurities.\nStudy QHD00011\nCollection of safety data:\n\u2022 All subjects were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination. Any unsolicited systemic adverse\nevents (AEs) occurring during that time were recorded as immediate unsolicited systemic AEs in the\nCase Report Book (CRB).\n\u2022 Solicited reactions were collected up to 7 days after vaccination (D0 to D7), and unsolicited AEs\nwere collected up to 28 days after vaccination (D0 to D28 [V02]).

These AESIs include new onset of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS),\nencephalitis / myelitis (including transverse myelitis), Bell\u2019s palsy, optic neuritis, and brachial neuritis.\n\u2022 Staff contact subjects by telephone at D180 post-vaccination to review the memory aid and to\nidentify the occurrence of any SAEs and AESIs that had not yet been reported.\n\u2022 Interactive response technology (IRT) was used to randomly assign subjects, in each age group, to\none of the two vaccine groups and to assign subject numbers in each of the groups.\n\u2022 Electronic data capture is used for the collection of data.\nSafety findings within 28 days of vaccination. Safety analysis were performed on the SafAS, which\nconsisted of a total of 1,533 subjects.\nIn the over 65 years old subgroup, which is pertinent to the approved indication, injection site\nreactions and systemic solicited reactions were reported with higher rates by the subjects who\nreceived QIV-HD vs the subjects who received QIV-SD (49.4% vs 28.3 % and 34.6% vs 26.2 %).\nRates of unsolicited AEs and adverse reactions (ARs) were also higher in the QIV-HD group vs the\nQIV-SD group.\nThe unsolicited non-serious ARs reported for the QIV-HD and QIV-SD groups were found to be\nsimilar in adults 60 to 64 years of age and adults 65 years of age and older.\nWithin 28 days of vaccination, one AE (intervertebral disc protrusion) reported by one subject (60 to\n64 years age group) in the QIV-HD group led to withdrawal from the study. This AE was assessed as\nnot related to the study vaccine by the Investigator.\nNo deaths or AESIs were reported within 28 days of vaccination.\nWithin 28 days of vaccination, a total of five SAEs were reported by five subjects in the QIV-HD group\nand five SAEs were reported by five subjects in the QIV-SD group.\nSAEs reported were acute myocardial infarction (16 hours 55 minutes after receipt of vaccine)\npilonidal cyst, cerebral thrombosis, transient ischaemic attack, and exacerbation of intermittent \nSwissPAR\n15 / 18\nSwissmedic \u2022 Hallerstrasse 7 \u2022 3012 Berne \u2022 www.swissmedic.ch \u2022 Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 \u2022 Fax +41 58 462 02 12\nclaudication in the QIV-HD group.

Pre-vaccination hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) GMTs and seroprotection rates\nwere similar between the groups for all strains.\nOut of the 2,670 randomised subjects, 16 (0.6%) subjects did not complete the study: 10 (0.6%), 3\n(0.7%), and 3 (0.7%) subjects in the QIV-HD, TIV-HD1, and TIV-HD2 groups, respectively.\nTwo subjects each in the QIV-HD and TIV-HD1 groups withdrew due to an AE.\nOther reasons for discontinuation were lost to follow-up (3 subjects in the QIV-HD group), protocol\ndeviation (4, 1 and 2 subjects in the QIV-HD, TIV-HD1, and TIV-HD2 groups, respectively), and\nvoluntary withdrawal by subject not due to an adverse event (AE) (1 subject each in the QIV-HD and\nTIV-HD2 groups).\nThe primary objective was to demonstrate that Efluelda induces an immune response (as assessed\nby HAI geometric mean titres [GMTs] and seroconversion rates) that is non-inferior to responses\ninduced by TIV-HD1 and TIV-HD2 for the 4 virus strains at 28 days post-vaccination in all subjects.\nSecondary objectives were:\n- To demonstrate that each B strain in the QIV-HD induces an immune response (as assessed by\nHAI GMTs and seroconversion rates) that is superior to the response induced by the TIV-HD that\ndoes not contain the corresponding B strain in all subjects.\n- To describe the immune response induced by QIV-HD, TIV-HD1, and TIV-HD2 by the HAI\nmeasurement method in all subjects.\n- To describe the immune response 28 days after vaccination by the virus SN measurement\nmethod in a randomised subset of subjects from each study group.\n- To describe the safety profiles of all subjects in each trial group.\nFor the A strains, the primary objective was evaluated using pooled data from TIV-HD1 and TIV-HD2\ngroups. For each of the B strains, the primary objective was evaluated based on the TIV-HD group\ncontaining the corresponding B strain.\nThe primary objective of non-inferiority of QIV-HD to TIV-HD as assessed by GMTs and\nseroconversion rates was met, as the lower limit of the 95% CI was above 0.667 for the ratio of\nGMTs and above -10% for the differences of seroconversion rates for all influenza strains.\nThe predefined non-inferiority margins were acceptable.\nFor a tabulated presentation of the primary endpoint results please see the \u201cEfficacy\u201d section of the\ninformation for healthcare professionals.\nThe secondary immunogenicity objective, to demonstrate that each B strain in QIV-HD induces\nsuperior immune response (as assessed by HAI GMTs and seroconversion rates) to the response\ninduced by the TIV-HD that does not contain the corresponding B strain, was met, as the lower limit of \nSwissPAR\n11 / 18\nSwissmedic \u2022 Hallerstrasse 7 \u2022 3012 Berne \u2022 www.swissmedic.ch \u2022 Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 \u2022 Fax +41 58 462 02 12\nthe 95% CI was above 1.5 for the ratios of GMTs and above 10% for the seroconversion rates for\nboth B influenza strains.\nFor the QIV-HD, TIV-HD1, and TIV-HD2 groups, the percentages of subjects who achieved\nseroprotection were 95.1%, 96.7%, and 95.6% against the A/H1N1 strain, respectively; 96.9%,\n96.9%, and 96.7% against the A/H3N2 strain, respectively; 99.0%, 99.1%, and 96.5% against the\nB/Brisbane strain, respectively; and 99.3%, 96.7%, and 99.1% against the B/Phuket strain,\nrespectively.\nOf note, seroprotection rates for those B strains that are not included in the respective TIV-HD1 or\nTIV-HD2 were similar to the seroprotection rates for the B strain that is included in the vaccine. This\nmight be the result of cross-reactive antibodies.\nImmunogenicity assessed by covariate factors showed lower post-vaccination GMTs and\nseroconversion rates for subjects over 75 years of age compared to subjects 65-75 years of age.\nFurther subgroup analysis showed higher post vaccination GMTs and seroconversion rates in female\nthan in male subjects and in subjects with no history of previous influenza vaccination the prior year\ncompared to subjects with a history of an influenza vaccination the prior year.\nGMTs (pre- and post-vaccination), geometric mean titre ratios (GMTRs), and fold rises (2- and 4-fold)\nwere similar among all study groups for both influenza A strains and for each of the B strains when\nQIV-HD is compared with the corresponding TIV-HD containing the same B strain when measured by\nthe SN assay.\nThe anti-NA Ab response against the N1 antigen in the A/H1N1 strain and N2 antigen in the A/H3N2\nstrain was assessed by ELLA as an additional immunogenicity analysis. The clinical relevance of the\nimmune response measured by the neutralisation and ELLA assays is currently not fully understood;\nfurthermore, there is no correlate of protection established either for the neutralising antibody titres, or\nfor the antibody response against the neuraminidase.\nIn summary, Efluelda in subjects over 65 years of age demonstrated non-inferior immunogenicity\ncompared to TIV-HD.\nStudy FIM12\nFIM12 was a phase III/IV, randomised, modified double-blind multicentre efficacy study conducted in\nthe USA and Canada with the licensed TIV-HD in healthy adults >65 years without moderate-tosevere acute illness.\nThe efficacy was assessed over two seasons, the first season enrolled 14,500 subjects (7,254 TIVHD, 7,246 TIV); the second season enrolled 17,489 subjects (8,737 TIV-HD, 8,752 TIV).\nThere was one primary endpoint with a statistical hypothesis: \u201cOccurrences of culture- or PCRconfirmed influenza (\u2265 14 days post-vaccination) caused by any influenza viral type/subtype, in\nassociation with a protocol-defined ILI.\u201d\nThe per protocol ILI definition included low-grade fever >37.2\u00b0C in combination of 2 of multiple\nsymptoms (e.g. wheezing and headache without cough and without sore throat). This was not fully in\nline with the CDC (>37.2\u00b0C and cough or sore throat) or with the WHO 2014 ILI definition of fever\n>38.0\u00b0C1\n. For the primary endpoint, Fluzone High-Dose would be considered superior to Fluzone if\nthe lower bound of the CI for relative VE was > 9.1%; 95% of enrolled subjects were evaluable for\nrelative VE.\nThe primary endpoint with the per protocol ILI definition was fulfilled with 24.24% (95% CI 9.69; 36.52)\ncombined over 2 years. Of note, the lower boundary of the 95% CI was not >9.1% for year 1 and 2\nseparately, and the additional primary analyses with modified CDC-defined influenza-like illness\ncriteria and with ILI definition associated with respiratory illness were both not statistically significant.\nAs there were no statistical hypotheses or corrections for multiple testing regarding any of the\nsecondary or observational endpoints or the exploratory endpoints, including effectiveness data on\n 1 https://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/ili_sari_surveillance_case_definition/en/\nSwissPAR\n12 / 18\nSwissmedic \u2022 Hallerstrasse 7 \u2022 3012 Berne \u2022 www.swissmedic.ch \u2022 Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 \u2022 Fax +41 58 462 02 12\nhospitalisations and pneumonia, these are not presented in the information for healthcare\nprofessionals.\nFIM12 was the successor study of Study FIM07, which was a randomised, double-blind, activecontrolled, multi-centre trial assessing the relative efficacy of TIV-HD to that of TIV-SD in adults 65\nyears of age and older, with respect to laboratory-confirmed influenza illness caused by viral\ntypes/subtypes antigenically similar to those contained in the respective annual vaccine formulations.\nAs the primary endpoint regarding matching influenza strains could not be reached due to the A/H1N1\nswine flu pandemic in 2009, the study was terminated earlier than planned, after one season.\nStudy QHD00011\nStudy QHD00011 compared the immunogenicity and safety of Efluelda to a standard-dose\nquadrivalent influenza vaccine approved in Switzerland. This was a phase III, randomised, modified\ndouble-blind, multicentre study conducted in Europe with approximately 1,540 healthy adults (770\nadults 60 to 64 years of age and 770 adults 65 years of age and older).\nThe primary objective of superiority of QIV-HD to QIV-SD as assessed by HAI GMTs was met, as the\nlower limit of the two-sided 95% CI was above 1 for the ratio of GMTs for all influenza strains in each\nage group. A stringent superiority criterion, as defined by a lower bound of the 95% CI for the ratio of\ngeometric mean HAI titres of >1.5, would have been preferable.\nThe immunogenicity results for subjects over 65 years of age are presented in a tabulated form in the\ninformation for healthcare professionals.\nSeroconversion and seroprotection rates in both vaccine groups met the CBER criteria (lower bound\nof the two-sided 95% CI for the percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion for HI antibodies\nshould meet or exceed 30%, and the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the percentage of\nsubjects achieving an HI antibody titre \u2265 1:40 should meet or exceed 60%) for all strains in subjects\nolder than 65 years of age. The rates of seroconversion and seroprotection were, in most cases,\nnumerically higher for the QIV-HD group. See also Table 2 in the information for healthcare\nprofessionals for the details.\nThe immunogenicity/safety and the efficacy of the TIV-HD compared to standard-dose influenza\nvaccine is relevant, as the higher HA content included in the vaccine needs to be justified with the\ndemonstration of added benefit for the vaccinated population, especially taking into account the\nhigher rate of reactogenicity due to the increased HA amount and the consequently higher amount of\nimpurities\nSupportive Study conducted with TIV-HD- FIM05\nStudy FIM05, after having demonstrated the consistency of three different lots of TIV-HD, assessed\nas the second primary objective the immunogenicity of the TIV-HD (Fluzone-HD) - pooled data from\nthe three lots - compared to standard-dose TIV (Fluzone). The criterion of superiority was met for both\nseroconversion and GMT ratios as, according to the protocol, it was sufficient to show superiority for\ntwo of the three vaccine strains and non-inferiority for the third strain.\nSuperiority could not be demonstrated for the TIV-HD vaccine over the standard-dose trivalent\nvaccine for the B strain, based on any of the predefined criteria (seroconversion, GMT ratios). For the\nB strain non-inferiority criteria were met. ",

Vaccination, especially for risk groups that have a higher chance of experiencing\ncomplications or more severe influenza disease, is recommended by several medical organisations,\nsocieties, and national immunisation technical advisory groups in order to reduce the influenzaassociated morbidity and mortality.\nThe burden of influenza infection and complications is the highest in older adults over 65 years.\n\u201cApproximately 90% of influenza-related deaths and 50-70% of influenza-related hospitalisations\noccur among people in this age group in the US. Because of their increased risk, older adults are a\npriority group for vaccination.\u201d2\nIn support of this current application, the company submitted a comprehensive dossier. Two studies\nwere considered pivotal for the application.\nStudy FIM12 evaluated the efficacy of the TIV-HD relative to standard-dose TIV regarding any\nPCR/culture-proven protocol defined ILI in the elderly. The primary endpoint for demonstrating\nsuperiority with the per protocol ILI definition was fulfilled with 24.24% (95% CI 9.69; 36.52) combined\nover 2 years, as the lower boundary of of the 95% CI exceeded the pre-defined threshold of 9.1%.\nThe other pivotal study, QHD00013, was intended to bridge the QIV-HD to the TIV-HD by\ndemonstrating comparable immunogenicity and safety profiles. Study QHD00013 met its primary\nobjectives, demonstrating that QIV-HD was non-inferior to TIV-HD1 and TIV-HD2 as assessed by the\nHAI GMTs and seroconversion rates for all four strains on day 28 post-vaccination.\nThe seroprotection rates were high for all strains at 28 days after vaccine administration for the QIVHD vaccine, ranging from 95.1-99.3%.\nStudy QHD00013 reached its endpoints for making the immunological bridging possible and allowed\nthe efficacy data obtained with the TIV-HD vaccine to be inferred to the QIV-HD.\nIn Study QHD00013, one of the pivotal studies supporting this application, QIV-HD demonstrated\nnon-inferior immunogenicity for all four strains as assessed by the GMTs and seroconversion at 28\ndays post-vaccination compared to TIV-HD. In case of the A strains, comparison was made to the\npooled data of the two TIV-HDs containing one of the B types and, in case of the B strains to the TIVHD with the corresponding B type.\nFor the two B strains, superiority as assessed by the GMTs and seroconversion rates could be\ndemonstrated compared to the vaccines with the alternate B type. The seroprotection rates were\nsimilar for the vaccine groups for all strains. These results of Study QHD00013 demonstrated that the\nimmunogenicity of the QIV-HD vs TIV-HD is comparable, and that the additional B type does not\ninterfere with the immune response of the other strains in a mostly pre-vaccinated elderly population.\nAs well as demonstrating comparable immunogenicity of the QIV-HD to the TIV-HD vaccines, Study\nQHD00013 was intended to provide immunological bridging to the TIV-HD.\nVaccines used in the pivotal efficacy study performed with the TIV-HD vaccine (FIM12) was\nconducted with vaccines manufactured with the legacy process and the control vaccine in Study\nQHD00013 with the current process.\n 2 https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2018-2019/hopitalization-rates-older.html\nSwissPAR\n16 / 18\nSwissmedic \u2022 Hallerstrasse 7 \u2022 3012 Berne \u2022 www.swissmedic.ch \u2022 Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 \u2022 Fax +41 58 462 02 12\nComparability of the vaccine products has been evaluated by quality attributes, although it would have\nbeen preferable to demonstrate the comparability by clinical studies.\nWith its answer to the Preliminary Decision, the company submitted results from Study QHD00011\nassessing the immunogenicity and safety of QIV-HD to a standard dose quadrivalent influenza\nvaccine approved in Switzerland.\nThe submission did not provide data on clinical efficacy or effectiveness data specific to the QIV-HD.\nFurthermore, data on the co-administration of the QIV-HD or the TIV-HD with other vaccines were not\navailable.\nSubjects in Study FIM05 who received TIV-HD had higher rates of solicited reactions compared to\nsubjects who received standard-dose TIV, which was mostly driven by the higher rates of solicited\ninjection site reactions.\nTIV-HD was non-inferior to standard Fluzone for the systemic reactions of headache, malaise, and\nmyalgia, and was inferior for \u201cmoderate or severe\u201d fever.\nIn Study QHD00013, no new safety concerns were identified for QIV-HD compared to TIV-HD,\nalthough a slightly greater reactogenicity was observed with the QIV-HD. This could be explained by\nthe higher amounts of HA and impurities. No imbalances in the frequency or severity of unsolicited\nadverse events were observed between the groups, and serious or uncommon conditions were not\nobserved at unexpectedly high frequencies in any group.\nIn Study QHD00011, injection site reactions and systemic solicited reactions were reported at higher\nrates by the subjects who received QIV-HD vs the subjects who received QIV-SD, and the rates of\nunsolicited AEs and ARs were also numerically higher in the QIV-HD group vs the QIV-SD group.\nSix-month safety data are still missing, as data collection was still ongoing at the time of submission\nof the response to the Preliminary Decision.\nThe information for healthcare professionals and the RMP were updated with the data based on the\nresults of the study. The company confirmed the implementation of the annual \"Enhanced safety\nsurveillance\" (EPSS) activities and committed to submit a PSUR/PBRER annually. Additionally, the\nfinal clinical study report for QHD00011 is the subject of a post authorisation requirement.\nThe safety profile of Efluelda is adequate, and the higher reactogenicity compared to the standarddose quadrivalent influenza vaccine and also to the TIV-HD can be accepted.\nOverall, the benefit/risk for Efluelda for adults over 65 years of age with the approved indication is\nconsidered to be positive based on the submitted data.\nIn the absence of specific efficacy studies with Efluelda, non-inferior immunogenicity results\ndemonstrated comparability with the TIV-HD. This immunobridging of the QIV-HD to the TIV-HD\nallowed the efficacy results demonstrated for the TIV-HD to be applied to Efluelda.\nThe additionally submitted QHD00011 study provided further relevant confirmatory information on the\nimmunogenicity and safety of Efluelda compared to a standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine.\nAs a post-authorisation requirement the final study report for Study QHD00011, including the sixmonth follow-up safety data, will be submitted to allow further assessment of SAEs, deaths and\nAESIs.",

        "full-text": "The summary of clinical safety provides data on 660 patients in total. There are three safety pools.\nThe IMMU-132-05 safety pool comprises 258 patients treated with SG and 224 patients treated with\nactive control (TPC; eribulin, gemcitabine, capecitabine, vinorelbine). The TNBC safety pool (366\npatients) comprises the patients from study IMMU-132-05 and IMMU-132-01 with TNBC and two prior\nlines of treatment. The IMMU-132-01 study had enrolled 144 patients with TNBC, however, those\npatients who had not received two prior lines of treatment in the metastatic setting were not included\nin the TNBC pool but in the all-treated SG safety pool (660 patients).\nExposure\nTreatment duration was similar between the randomised phase 3 study IMMU-132-05 (4.4 months)\nand all SG treated patients (4.1 months), and longer than for control patients (1.3 months). Dose\nreductions were observed in approximately 30% of all SG safety pools, and most patients had only\none dose reduction. Mean dose intensity was >90%, and the median dose intensity was >98% for all\nsafety pools (IMMU-132-05, TNBC, and all). Most patients discontinued treatment due to progressive\ndisease (PD), 84% in the TNBC safety pool and 75% in the all-treated safety pool. However, in the\ncontrol arm of the phase 3 IMMU-132-05 study, 8% of patients discontinued due to withdrawal of\nconsent. Only 3.8% of patients discontinued SG for adverse events (AEs) in the TNBC pool and 6.8%\nin the all-treated safety pool.\nIn study IMMU-132-05, AEs leading to treatment interruptions were more frequent in the SG arm\n(63%) compared to the control arm (39%). Most frequent reasons for treatment interruption were\nhaematological toxicity (despite higher use of GCSF in the SG arm compared to the control arm),\ninfectious complications and gastrointestinal toxicity (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting). These frequencies\nwere similar in all safety pools.\nIncidence of AEs\nTreatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (98% vs 86%), TEAEs of \u2265 grade 3 (75% vs 65%), and\nTEAEs leading to study drug interruption (55% vs 39%) were more frequent in the SG safety pools\ncompared to the control arm of the IMMU-132-05 study (TPC). Serious TEAEs were similar in\nincidence in the two TNBC safety pools (~27%) and comparable with the incidence in the control arm\n(28%) of the phase 3 study for TNBC. However, in the all-SG treated safety pool, the incidence of\nserious AEs (SAEs) was higher (35%).\nMost frequent AEs\nThe most frequent AEs were gastrointestinal toxicity, haematological toxicity and general conditions.\nThe preferred terms were diarrhoea (64%), nausea (67%), vomiting (40%), constipation (38%),\nabdominal pain (22%), neutropenia (61%), anaemia (41%), fatigue (52%), headache (17%),\nalopecia (44%), and rash (21%). The frequencies of these AEs were comparable between the three\nsafety pools. All of these AEs were considered treatment-related.\nGrade 3/4 AEs\nThere were only a few grade 4 AEs and mostly involved neutropenia. In the IMMU-132-05 study,\nthere was one grade 4 nausea and 1 grade 4 vomiting AE. Grade 3 diarrhoea was observed in 11%\nof patients in the IMMU-132-05 study, grade 3 neutropenia (including neutrophil count decreased) in\n28%, grade 3 anaemia in 9% and grade 3 nausea and abdominal pain in 3% of patients in each case.\nDeaths\nIn the all-patient safety pool, there were 12 on-treatment deaths. There was one death considered\ntreatment-related in the all-treated SG safety pool, but none in the TNBC safety pool. The one death\nconsidered treatment-related in the all-treated safety pool was due to an aspiration pneumonia in a\npatient with NSCLC who had presented nausea after each administration of SG.\nSerious AEs\nIn the IMMU-132-05 study, the overall incidence of SAEs was similar between the two treatment\narms. In the SG arm, more patients had febrile neutropenia (5%), diarrhoea (3.5%) and\npneumonia (2.7%).

        "full-text": "The applicant submitted one pivotal study (IMMU-132-05) and one supportive study (IMMU-132-01)\nfor the requested indication.\nPivotal study IMMU-132-05\nIMMU-132-05 is a 1:1 randomised, open-label, phase 3 study comparing sacituzumab govitecan (SG)\nwith treatment of the physician\u2019s choice (TPC) in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer\n(mTNBC) having received at least two prior lines of systemic chemotherapy, one of which could have\nbeen in the (neo)adjuvant setting, for their disease including a taxane. TPC consisted of single-agent\nchemotherapy (eribulin, capecitabine, gemcitabine or vinorelbine), all of which are standard\ntreatments in this disease setting. Investigators had to determine the chemotherapy agent before\nrandomisation. Treatment was continued until progression, toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death,\nwhichever occurred first.\nThe primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by an\nindependent review committee (IRC), in patients without known brain metastases at baseline (BM-\nneg). Secondary endpoints were PFS in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, overall survival (OS) in\nthe ITT and in the BM-neg population, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR),\nquality of life and safety.\nPatients were stratified according to prior number of treatment lines (2-3 vs >3), geographic location\n(North America versus Rest of the World) and presence or absence of known brain metastases at\nbaseline. The number of patients with known and stable brain metastases at baseline was limited to\n15%.\nIt is important to note that approximately 25-27% of mTNBC patients develop brain metastases over\nthe course of their disease [11] and therefore a cap of 15% is not representative of the true incidence\nof brain metastases in these patients.\nThe study included women or men with metastatic TNBC, defined as <1% ER and PR and HER2-\nnegative. Measurable disease was required. Patients with brain metastases were allowed if previously\ntreated and stable. Patients had received a minimum of two prior lines of systemic treatment for\nunresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (regardless of whether the breast cancer\nwas triple negative at that time or not). If patients relapsed within 12 months of (neo)adjuvant\ntreatment, the (neo)adjuvant regimen was counted as one line of prior therapy. PARP-inhibitor\ntherapy in BRCA-mutated patients was considered as a treatment line. Patients must have received a\nprior taxane unless they were intolerant to it or had a contraindication. Patients also had to present an\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, have adequate organ\nfunction, no residual toxicities and a life expectancy of 3 months or greater.\nExclusion criteria were numerous. Patients with Gilbert\u2019s disease were excluded based on the known\nrisk of toxicity to irinotecan in these patients and the SN-38 payload of SG, which is the active\nmetabolite of irinotecan. Prior malignancies were allowed with at least 3 years of disease-free interval.\nActive inflammatory bowel disease and history of bowel obstruction were exclusion criteria, as was\nany history of clinically significant bleeding.\nOverall, inclusion and exclusion criteria are reasonable. They certainly lead to a selection bias\nbecause patients with heavily pre-treated mTNBC have a very short median OS. However, clinically,\nonly patients in good general condition despite the advanced disease will be offered another line of\ntreatment. Therefore, the patient selection criteria still reasonably reflect the population. However,\nmore than 15% of patients with mTNBC after two or more prior treatment lines will have brain\nmetastases, and these were not adequately represented in this study.\nSG was administered on days 1 and 8 of 21-day treatment cycles until progression or toxicity. The\nsingle-agent chemotherapy drugs constituting the TPC were administered at registered doses and\nintervals.\nRadiologic assessment was performed every 6 weeks until 36 weeks and every 9 weeks thereafter by\ncomputed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Only patients with known brain\nmetastases at baseline had brain MRIs.\nStatistics\nA hazard ratio (HR) of 0.667, likely corresponding to a 50% improvement in PFS, was considered to\nbe clinically meaningful in this relapsed/refractory locally advanced or metastatic TNBC patient\npopulation. A total of 488 patients were anticipated to be enrolled. The population of patients with\nbrain metastases was limited to 15% (N=74) of the study population. The primary PFS analysis was\nperformed when 425 investigator-defined PFS events had occurred in all randomised patients,\nprovided 315 or more PFS events by IRC review had also occurred in the primary analysis population\n(i.e., BM-neg population). Assuming that 15% of patients at most had brain metastasis and that there\nwere 13% or fewer PFS events by IRC assessment than by investigator assessment, it was expected\nthat there would be at least 315 PFS events by IRC assessment in the BM-neg population at the time\n425 PFS events by investigator assessment were observed in all randomised patients. If the true HR\nwas 0.667 in the IRC review of the BM-neg population, the study had at least 95% power to detect a\nstatistically significant improvement in PFS, with a two-sided type 1 error rate of 5%, if data were\nanalysed after 315 PFS events by IRC assessment. OS was analysed at the time of PFS analysis and\nalso after 330 deaths had occurred in the BM-neg population. The study had approximately 89.5%\npower to detect an improvement in OS in the BM-neg population, with a two-sided 5% type 1 error\nrate, assuming that 72% of the planned number of deaths in BM-neg population had occurred at the\ntime of the interim analysis (i.e., 238 deaths) and the true HR for OS was 0.7.\nThe overall type I error rate was controlled by a hierarchical testing strategy. The primary endpoint of\nPFS by IRC assessment was analysed and tested first in the BM-neg population. If the primary\nanalysis test was significant, subsequent key secondary endpoints (OS in the BM-neg population,\nPFS by IRC assessment in the ITT population, OS in the ITT population) were tested in a sequential\nmanner, where a given hypothesis was only declared statistically significant if all hypotheses above it\nin the hierarchy were also statistically significant.\nThe protocol was amended six times. The most important amendments were an increase in sample\nsize from 328 to 488 and, in Amendment 5, the removal of the interim futility analysis.\nAssumptions for PFS and OS are reasonable, and the statistical analysis plan is adequate.\nResults: Study Population\nThe study screened 730 patients, and 529 patients were randomised, 267 to SG and 262 to TPC.\nMost patients did not have brain metastases at baseline, and only 61 patients with known brain\nmetastases were randomised. In total, 32 patients were randomised to SG and 29 to TPC. In the\ncontrol arm, 38 (14.5%) patients were randomised but did not receive treatment.\nAt the time of study completion (11 March 2020), 15 patients (6.4%) were still on study treatment in\nthe SG arm versus none in the control arm. The most common reasons for study discontinuation in\nthe control arm were death (76%) and withdrawal of consent (10%). These were also the main\nreasons for study discontinuation in the SG arm, but to a lesser extent (64% death, 3% withdrawal of\nconsent).\nBaseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between the two arms. Only two\nmale patients were enrolled in the study and they were both randomised to the SG arm. Nearly all\npatients (95%) had prior breast cancer surgery. Approximately 27% had received prior PD-1/PD-L1\ntherapy and 80% had prior (non-brain) radiotherapy.\nOverall, patients in the SG arm received concomitant medication more frequently compared to\npatients in the control arm. Some of these medications reflect the use of corticosteroids and anti-\nhistamines to prevent infusion reactions. However, there was also more use of anti-emetics, likely\nreflecting the emetogenic potential of SG. Nearly half of the patients in the SG arm (46.4%) received\ngranulocyte colony stimulating factors (GCSF) compared to just under 20% of patients in the control\narm. Patients in the SG arm also received more antibacterial and antiviral medication. Overall, there\nwas an important imbalance between the two treatment arms, with a large number of medications\nbeing administered more frequently in the SG arm.\nResults: Efficacy\nThe IRC-assessed median PFS in the brain metastases-negative (BM-neg) population is 5.6 months\n(95% CI: 4.3, 6.3) in the SG arm versus 1.7 months (95% CI: 1.5, 2.6) in the control arm. This\nobserved benefit of 3.9 months PFS with an HR of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.52) is statistically significant\n(p <0.0001) and clinically meaningful in this heavily pre-treated patient population. No PFS benefit is\nobserved in the small group of patients with brain metastases. Median PFS is 2.8 months (95% CI:\n1.5, 3.9) in the SG arm versus 1.6 months (95% CI: 1.3, 2.9) in the control arm. All sensitivity\nanalyses performed for PFS are consistent with the primary analysis. All subgroups independent of\nage, race, number of prior therapies, and region of the world, Trop-2 expression, and presence or\nabsence of liver metastases show a benefit for SG over control.\nThe secondary endpoint of PFS in the ITT population also shows a statistically significant PFS benefit\nof SG over TPC, with 4.8 months median PFS versus 1.7 months, respectively. The HR is 0.43 (95%\nCI 0.35, 0.54) with a p-value of <0.0001. However, this finding is expected given the 15% enrolment\ncap on brain metastases-positive patients. Therefore, the additional patients in the ITT population are\nunlikely to change the finding of the majority of patients without brain metastases.\nThe secondary endpoint of OS in BM-neg patients was also reached. Median OS is 12.1 months\n(95% CI: 10.7, 14.0) in the SG arm versus 6.7 months (95% CI: 5.8, 7.7) in the control arm. The HR is\n0.48 (95% CI: 0.38, 0.59) and the p-value <0.0001. In the ITT population, median OS is 11.8 months\nin the SG arm and 6.9 months in the control arm. As for PFS, no benefit was observed in the small\nbrain metastases-positive population, with a median OS of 6.8 months (95% CI: 4.7, 14.1) in the SG\narm versus 7.5 months (95% CI: 4.7, 11.1) in the control arm. The HR is 0.87 (95% CI: 0.47, 1.63).\nOther secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). SG\nwas superior to TPC in these secondary endpoints.\nSupportive study IMMU-132-001\nThe supportive study IMMU-132-01 was a phase 1/2 dose-finding and dose-expansion study. It\nincluded 144 patients with TNBC, of whom 108 had received at least two prior lines of treatment for\nmetastatic disease. The recommended phase 2 dose was 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 of 21-day\ncycles.\nResults from this study show an ORR of 33%, a clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 45%, a median PFS of\n5.6 months and a median OS of 13.0 months. While this is an uncontrolled study, the results are\nconsistent with those observed in the randomised phase 3 study and are considered supportive.",

The primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients without\nknown brain metastases at baseline was reached, with an improvement of 3.9 months, from 1.7 to 5.6\nmonths median PFS. The hazard ratio is 0.41 and the result is highly statistically significant and\nclinically meaningful. In addition, OS was also significantly improved from 6.7 to 12.1 months in the\nbrain metastases-negative patient population. This 5.4 month benefit in OS is statistically significant\nand clinically meaningful.\nPatients with brain metastases were only allowed to enrol if they had stable lesions, and a maximum\nof 15% of patients with brain metastases were allowed. The study enrolled 61 patients with brain\nmetastases of whom 29 were randomised to the control arm and 32 to the SG arm. There was no\napparent benefit of SG over control in PFS or OS in this small population. This finding is adequately\nreflected in the information for healthcare professionals.\nAlthough SG is an antibody-drug conjugate, the toxicity profile is linked to the drug moiety of SN-38,\nwith diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, haematological toxicity with neutropenia and\nanaemia as well as fatigue. Electrolyte imbalances are also observed, likely due - at least in part - to\ndiarrhoea. Alopecia is observed in nearly half of all patients and is mostly of grade 2 (complete hair\nloss). Nevertheless, there is no excess of fatal AEs, and the toxicity seems to be manageable with\nsupportive treatment such as anti-diarrhoeal medication, anti-emetic treatment and hematologic growth\nfactors.\nThe PK of SG has not been assessed in subjects with moderate or severe hepatic or renal\nimpairment. The risk arising from this lack of data is considered to be low in the case of renal\nimpairment and could be addressed by appropriate wording in the information for healthcare\nprofessionals.\nIn case of hepatic impairment, since there is a relevant risk that the exposure of SN-38 might be\nelevated, the use of SG in patents with moderate and severe hepatic impairment is not recommended.\nA study to determine a starting dose of SG in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, will be\nconducted as a PMR.\nThe immunogenicity of SG has not yet been characterised, because no validated assays with sufficient\ndrug tolerance and sensitivity have been developed so far. Analyses to characterise the immunogenicity\nof SG will be conducted as a PMR.\nPatients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer have an abysmal prognosis and limited\ntreatment options. SG has demonstrated efficacy in prolonging not only progression-free survival but\nalso overall survival in these heavily pre-treated patients. The OS benefit of 4.9 months in the ITT\npopulation is clinically meaningful. The toxicity is high but seems manageable with supportive\ntreatment, as in other oncologic diseases. Therefore, the risk-benefit is considered positive. While\npatients with brain metastases did not have a demonstrated benefit, they did not seem to suffer a\ndetriment and they have an important medical need.

        "summary": "Trodelvy is a cancer medicine containing the active substance sacituzumab govitecan and is administered as an infusion into a vein.\nTrodelvy is used to treat adults with a type of breast cancer known as metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC). This form of breast cancer is either so far advanced that it can no longer be removed or has already spread to other sites in the body (metastasised). The tumour cells also lack certain receptors. Receptors are very specific docking sites that exist for numerous substances. As soon as a specific substance binds to its receptor, it triggers a reaction in the cell. Triple-negative tumours have neither an oestrogen nor a progesterone receptor, nor do they possess an HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2). But these three receptors serve as possible sites of attack for other cancer medicines.\nBefore receiving treatment with Trodelvy, patients must have received at least two previous drug treatments for breast cancer that were not sufficiently effective.

Zu den ersten Symptomen solcher Reaktionen k\u00f6nnen Brustschmerzen geh\u00f6ren, die in Verbindung mit einer allergischen Reaktion auf Beta-Lactam-Antibiotika auftreten.\nPatienten mit einer \u00dcberempfindlichkeit gegen Carbapeneme, Penicilline oder andere Beta-Lactam-Antibiotika in der Vorgeschichte k\u00f6nnen ebenfalls \u00fcberempfindlich auf Meropenem/Vaborbactam reagieren. Vor Beginn der Therapie mit Vaborem sollte eine sorgf\u00e4ltige Pr\u00fcfung hinsichtlich fr\u00fcherer \u00dcberempfindlichkeitsreaktionen gegen Beta-Lactam-Antibiotika vorgenommen werden.\nSchwere kutane Arzneimittelreaktionen (SCAR) wie das Stevens-Johnson-Syndrom, toxische epidermale Nekrolyse, Arzneimittelexanthem mit Eosinophilie und systemischen Symptomen (DRESS), Erythema multiforme und akute generalisierte exanthemat\u00f6se Pustulosis (AGEP) wurden bei Patienten unter Behandlung mit Beta-Laktam-Antibiotika, einschliesslich Vaborem, berichtet (siehe auch \u00abUnerw\u00fcnschte Arzneimittelwirkungen\u00bb). Beim Auftreten solcher Reaktionen ist Vaborem unverz\u00fcglich abzusetzen und eine Alternativtherapie ist in Erw\u00e4gung zu ziehen.\nBei Auftreten einer schweren allergischen Reaktion muss die Behandlung mit Vaborem unverz\u00fcglich abgebrochen werden, und entsprechende Notfallmassnahmen m\u00fcssen eingeleitet werden.\nKrampfanf\u00e4lle\nW\u00e4hrend der Behandlung mit Meropenem wurden Krampfanf\u00e4lle berichtet (siehe \u00abUnerw\u00fcnschte Wirkungen\u00bb).\nPatienten mit bekannten Anfallsleiden sollten eine antikonvulsive Therapie fortsetzen. Patienten, die fokale Tremores, Myoklonien oder Krampfanf\u00e4lle entwickeln, sollten neurologisch untersucht werden und eine antikonvulsive Therapie erhalten, falls diese nicht bereits eingeleitet wurde. Falls erforderlich, sollte die Dosis von Meropenem/Vaborbactam abh\u00e4ngig von der Nierenfunktion angepasst werden (siehe \u00abDosierung/Anwendung\u00bb). Anderenfalls sollte Meropenem/Vaborbactam abgesetzt werden (siehe \u00abInteraktionen\u00bb).\n\u00dcberwachung der Leberfunktion\nWegen des Risikos einer Lebertoxizit\u00e4t (Leberfunktionsst\u00f6rung mit Cholestase und Zytolyse) sollte die Leberfunktion w\u00e4hrend der Behandlung mit Meropenem/Vaborbactam engmaschig \u00fcberwacht werden (siehe \u00abUnerw\u00fcnschte Wirkungen\u00bb).\nPatienten mit bestehenden Lebererkrankungen sollten die Leberfunktion w\u00e4hrend der Behandlung mit Meropenem/Vaborbactam \u00fcberwachen lassen. Eine Dosisanpassung ist nicht erforderlich (siehe \u00abDosierung/Anwendung\u00bb).\nTerminale Niereninsuffizienz (ESRD) oder schwere Nierenfunktionsst\u00f6rung\nEs ist zu erwarten, dass die Plasmakonzentrationen von Vaborbactam bei Patienten mit ESRD oder schwerer Nierenfunktionsst\u00f6rung in dem Bereich liegen, der in der tQT-Studie zu einer QTcF-Verl\u00e4ngerung gef\u00fchrt hat. Aus diesem Grund sollte Vaborem bei Patienten mit ESRD oder schwerer Nierenfunktionsst\u00f6rung mit bekannten Risikofaktoren f\u00fcr eine Verl\u00e4ngerung des QT-Intervalls und/oder mit gleichzeitiger Anwendung von Arzneimitteln, die bekanntermassen eine Verl\u00e4ngerung des QT-Intervalls zur Folge haben (siehe Eigenschaften/Wirkungen), mit Vorsicht angewendet werden.\nSerokonversion im Antiglobulintest (Coombs-Test)\nWie bei Meropenem kann w\u00e4hrend der Behandlung mit Meropenem/Vaborbactam ein direkter oder indirekter Coombs-Test positiv ausfallen (siehe \u00abUnerw\u00fcnschte Wirkungen\u00bb).\nClostridium difficile-assoziierte Diarrh\u00f6\nEs wurde bei Meropenem/Vaborbactam \u00fcber Clostridium difficile-assoziierte Diarrh\u00f6 berichtet. Der Schweregrad der Erkrankung kann von leichtem Durchfall bis zur t\u00f6dlichen Kolitis reichen. Die Erkrankung sollte daher bei Patienten mit Diarrh\u00f6 w\u00e4hrend oder nach der Anwendung von Vaborem in Betracht gezogen werden (siehe \u00abUnerw\u00fcnschte Wirkungen\u00bb). Ein Abbruch der Therapie mit Vaborem und die Anwendung einer spezifischen Behandlung f\u00fcr Clostridium difficile sollten in Betracht gezogen werden. Arzneimittel, die die Peristaltik hemmen, sollten nicht gegeben werden.\nAnwendung zusammen mit Valproins\u00e4ure/Natriumvalproat/Valpromid\nFallberichte in der Literatur haben gezeigt, dass die gleichzeitige Anwendung von Carbapenemen einschliesslich Meropenem an Patienten, die Valproins\u00e4ure oder Divalproex-Natrium erhalten, die Plasmaspiegel von Valproins\u00e4ure infolge der Wechselwirkung auf Konzentrationen unterhalb des therapeutischen Bereichs reduzieren kann, wodurch das Risiko des Auftretens von Anf\u00e4llen erh\u00f6ht wird. Wenn eine Anwendung von Vaborem notwendig ist, sollte eine zus\u00e4tzliche antikonvulsive Therapie in Betracht gezogen werden (siehe \u00abInteraktionen\u00bb).\nEinschr\u00e4nkung der klinischen Daten\nDie Anwendung von Vaborem zur Behandlung von Patienten mit komplizierten intraabdominellen Infektionen, einer nosokomial erworbenen Pneumonie einschliesslich einer Beatmungspneumonie, oder Bakteri\u00e4mie, die im Zusammenhang mit einer der indizierten Infektionen auftritt oder wenn ein entsprechender Zusammenhang vermutet wird, basiert auf Erfahrungen mit Meropenem als Monotherapie, pharmakokinetisch-pharmakodynamischen Analysen von Meropenem/Vaborbactam und auf begrenzten Daten aus einer randomisierten klinischen Studie, in der 32 Patienten mit Vaborem und 15 Patienten mit der besten verf\u00fcgbaren Therapie f\u00fcr Infektionen durch Carbapenem-resistente Organismen behandelt wurden (siehe \u00abEigenschaften/Wirkungen\u00bb).\nWirkspektrum von Meropenem/Vaborbactam\nMeropenem hat keine Wirkung auf Methicillin-resistente Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) und Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) oder Vancomycin-resistente Enterococci (VRE). Wenn erwiesen ist oder vermutet wird, dass diese Erreger zum Infektionsprozess beitragen, sollten alternative oder zus\u00e4tzliche antibakterielle Wirkstoffe angewendet werden.\nDas Inhibitionsspektrum von Vaborbactam umfasst Carbapenemasen der Klasse A (wie KPC) und Carbapenemasen der Klasse C. Vaborbactam inhibiert keine Klasse-D-Carbapenemasen wie OXA-48 oder Klasse-B-Metallo-Beta-Lactamasen wie NDM und VIM (siehe \u00abEigenschaften/Wirkungen\u00bb).\nNicht sensible Organismen\nDie Anwendung von Meropenem/Vaborbactam kann zu einer \u00dcberbesiedelung mit nicht sensiblen Organismen f\u00fchren, die eine Unterbrechung der Behandlung oder andere geeignete Massnahmen erfordern kann.\nNatrium-kontrollierte Di\u00e4t\nVaborem enth\u00e4lt 250 mg Natrium pro Durchstechflasche, entsprechend 12.5% der von der WHO f\u00fcr einen Erwachsenen empfohlenen maximalen t\u00e4glichen Natriumaufnahme mit der Nahrung von 2g.\nBei Umstellung der Therapie auf ein anderes Arzneimittel mit gleichem Wirkstoff ist Vorsicht geboten. Der Patient sollte ad\u00e4quat kontrolliert werden.\nInteraktionen\nIn-vitro-Daten deuten darauf hin, dass Vaborbactam und Meropenem CYP3A4 und CYP1A2 induzieren k\u00f6nnen. Bei einer gleichzeitigen Anwendung von Meropenem/Vaborbactam mit Arzneimitteln, die vorwiegend \u00fcber CYP3A4 und CYP1A2 metabolisiert werden, besteht das Risiko, dass eine m\u00f6gliche Wechselwirkung zu verminderten Plasmakonzentrationen des gleichzeitig angewendeten Arzneimittels f\u00fchren k\u00f6nnte.\nIn-vitro-Daten deuten darauf hin, dass Vaborbactam Pgp hemmen kann. Bei einer gleichzeitigen Anwendung von Meropenem/Vaborbactam mit Arzneimitteln, bei denen es sich um Pgp-Substrate handelt, besteht das Risiko, dass eine m\u00f6gliche Wechselwirkung zu einer erh\u00f6hten Plasmakonzentration des gleichzeitig angewendeten Arzneimittels f\u00fchren k\u00f6nnte.\nZwischen Meropenem und Vaborbactam wurden keine pharmakokinetischen Wechselwirkungen beobachtet.\nWirkung von Vaborem auf andere Arzneimittel\nDie gleichzeitige Anwendung von Meropenem und Valproins\u00e4ure war mit einer Verringerung der Valproins\u00e4urekonzentrationen und einem darauf folgenden Verlust der Anfallskontrolle verbunden.\nDaten aus in-vitro-Studien und tierexperimentellen Studien deuten darauf hin, dass Carbapeneme die Hydrolyse des Glucuronidmetaboliten der Valproins\u00e4ure (VPA g) zur\u00fcck zu Valproins\u00e4ure hemmen k\u00f6nnen und damit die Serumkonzentrationen von Valproins\u00e4ure verringern. Wenn eine gleichzeitige Anwendung von Valproins\u00e4ure und Meropenem/Vaborbactam nicht vermieden werden kann, sollte daher ein zus\u00e4tzliches antikonvulsives Mittel gegeben werden (siehe \u00abWarnhinweise und Vorsichtsmassnahmen\u00bb).\nOrale Antikoagulantien\nDie gleichzeitige Anwendung von Antibiotika mit Warfarin kann die gerinnungshemmende Wirkung verst\u00e4rken. Es gibt viele Berichte \u00fcber eine Verst\u00e4rkung der gerinnungshemmenden Wirkung oral angewendeter Antikoagulantien einschliesslich Warfarin bei Patienten, die gleichzeitig Antibiotika erhalten. Das Risiko kann mit der zugrunde liegenden Infektion, dem Alter und dem Allgemeinzustand des Patienten variieren. Der Einfluss des Antibiotikums auf den Anstieg des INR-Werts (international normalised ratio) ist daher schwierig zu bestimmen. Es wird empfohlen, den INR-Wert w\u00e4hrend und kurz nach der gemeinsamen Anwendung von Vaborem und einem oralen Antikoagulans h\u00e4ufig zu \u00fcberwachen.\nWirkung anderer Arzneimittel auf Vaborem\nSowohl Meropenem als auch Vaborbactam sind Substrate von OAT3; von daher konkurriert Probenecid mit Meropenem um die aktive tubul\u00e4re Sekretion und hemmt so die renale Ausscheidung von Meropenem. Derselbe Mechanismus k\u00f6nnte auch auf Vaborbactam zutreffen. Die gleichzeitige Anwendung von Probenecid und Vaborem wird nicht empfohlen, da dies zu erh\u00f6hten Plasmakonzentrationen von Meropenem und Vaborbactam f\u00fchren kann.\nSchwangerschaft, Stillzeit\nSchwangerschaft\nBisher liegen keine oder nur sehr begrenzte Erfahrungen (weniger als 300 Schwangerschaftsausg\u00e4nge) mit der Anwendung von Meropenem/Vaborbactam bei Schwangeren vor. Tierexperimentelle Studien ergaben keine Hinweise auf direkte oder indirekte gesundheitssch\u00e4dliche Wirkungen in Bezug auf eine Reproduktionstoxizit\u00e4t (siehe \u00abpr\u00e4klinische Daten\u00bb).\nVorsichtshalber sollte die Anwendung von Vaborem w\u00e4hrend der Schwangerschaft vermieden werden.\nStillzeit\nEs wurde berichtet, dass Meropenem in die Muttermilch ausgeschieden wird. Es ist nicht bekannt, ob Vaborbactam beim Menschen oder bei Tieren in die Muttermilch \u00fcbergeht. Da ein Risiko f\u00fcr das Neugeborene/Kind nicht ausgeschlossen werden kann, muss das Stillen vor Einleitung der Behandlung unterbrochen werden.\nFertilit\u00e4t\nDie Wirkung von Meropenem/Vaborbactam auf die menschliche Fertilit\u00e4t wurde nicht untersucht. Tierexperimentelle Studien mit Meropenem und Vaborbactam weisen nicht auf sch\u00e4dliche Auswirkungen auf die Fertilit\u00e4t hin (siehe \u00abpr\u00e4klinische Daten\u00bb).\nWirkung auf die Fahrt\u00fcchtigkeit und auf das Bedienen von Maschinen\nEs wurden keine entsprechenden Studien durchgef\u00fchrt. Insbesondere bei Patienten, die mit Antikonvulsiva behandelt wurden (siehe \u00abWarnhinweise und Vorsichtsmassnahmen\u00bb), wurden Krampfanf\u00e4lle w\u00e4hrend der Behandlung mit Meropenem als Monotherapie berichtet. Meropenem/Vaborbactam kann Kopfschmerz, Par\u00e4sthesie, Lethargie und Schwindelgef\u00fchl verursachen (siehe \u00abUnerw\u00fcnschte Wirkungen\u00bb). Daher ist beim F\u00fchren von Fahrzeugen und beim Bedienen von Maschinen Vorsicht geboten.\nUnerw\u00fcnschte Wirkungen\nZusammenfassung des Sicherheitsprofils\nDie bei den 322 Patienten aus den zusammengefassten Phase-3-Studien am h\u00e4ufigsten berichteten Nebenwirkungen waren Kopfschmerz (8,1%), Diarrh\u00f6 (4,7%), Phlebitis an der Infusionsstelle (2,2%) und \u00dcbelkeit (2,2%).\nSchwere Nebenwirkungen wurden bei zwei Patienten beobachtet (0,6 %): eine Reaktion im Zusammenhang mit einer Infusion und ein Fall erh\u00f6hter alkalischer Phosphatasewerte im Blut. Bei einem weiteren Patienten wurde eine schwerwiegende Nebenwirkung in Form einer Reaktion im Zusammenhang mit einer Infusion berichtet (0,3%).\nTabellarische Auflistung der Nebenwirkungen\nDie folgenden Nebenwirkungen wurden unter Meropenem als Monotherapie berichtet und/oder w\u00e4hrend der Phase-3-Studien mit Vaborem festgestellt.

In this study, patients were randomised 2:1 to meropenem-vaborbactam\n(n=52) or BAT (n=25).\nThe baseline characteristics of the m-MITT population (microbiological modified intention to treat)\nwere largely comparable between the treatment groups. In both groups, 87% of the patients were\nwhite and 46% were female. The mean age was 63 years, and 49% and 26% of the patients were\nolder than 65 and 75 years, respectively, in the meropenem-vaborbactam group versus 42% older\nthan 65 years and 21% older than 75 years in the BAT group. The mean body mass index in both\ngroups was approximately 27.6 kg/m2. The majority of patients were enrolled in Europe and North\nAmerica.\nAt baseline, 37% in the meropenem-vaborbactam group and 47% in the BAT group had diabetes\nmellitus, 49% in the meropenem-vaborbactam group and 42% in the BAT group met the criteria for\nsystemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and 77% in the meropenem-vaborbactam group\nand 74% in the BAT group had a Charlson comorbidity index of \u22655. Most subjects (68% in the m-\nMITT population) in the BAT group received combination antibiotic therapy. The most frequently used\nantibiotics in combination antibiotic therapy were carbapenems (42% in the m-MITT population).\nThe primary efficacy endpoints were defined by indication (all-cause mortality for HAP, including VAP,\nand bacteraemia; eradication at test of cure (TOC)/overall success at end of treatment (EOT) for cIUI,\nincluding AP; and clinical cure at TOC for cIAI) and analysed for the microbiologically modified intention-\nto-treat population with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (mCRE-MITT) and the m-MITT\npopulation. Given the limited number of patients per indication, no statistical analysis was performed.\nAlthough this study was not designed for inferential testing, a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)\nrecommended early study termination due to evidence of benefit in the meropenem-vaborbactam\ngroup.\nOverview of Efficacy Results in Study 506\nThe overall results in all infection types combined can be considered indicative of a benefit of\nmeropenem-vaborbactam at the proposed dose in the treatment of infections caused by carbapenem-\nresistant Enterobacteriaceae. However, this study does not allow reliable conclusions to be drawn on\nefficacy, and thereby on the adequacy of the vaborbactam dose, in the separate infection types.\nAs meropenem is approved as monotherapy for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections and lower\nrespiratory tract infections, it can be assumed that appropriate concentrations of meropenem are\nreached for a sufficient duration at the infection sites. There is insufficient efficacy data to confirm this\nfor the proposed dose and prolonged duration compared to what is approved for meropenem\nmonotherapy. However, given that the new proposed dose with longer infusion time resulted in\nimproved attainment of the pharmacodynamic target, it can be assumed that the adjusted dose will\nnot negatively impact efficacy.\nFor vaborbactam, it is acknowledged that the preclinical data and PKPD analyses are supportive of\nefficacy of vaborbactam at the proposed dose. Based on similar properties of vaborbactam as\ncompared to meropenem, and similar drug properties in comparison to drugs known to penetrate well\ninto peritoneal fluid, it is expected that adequate concentrations of vaborbactam will be reached in the\nextracellular fluid and peritoneal fluid for the treatment of cIAI caused by CRE. Additional simulations\nto evaluate PKPD target attainment based on free-drug plasma PKPD targets and ELF exposures\nprovide further support for the use of meropenem-vaborbactam in the treatment of HAP/VAP.\nHowever, some uncertainties remain, as PKPD targets for ELF are not known and PK and penetration\nof meropenem and vaborbactam may be altered in patients with severe or critical HAP/VAP infection.\nAccording to the EMA Guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of\nbacterial infections, to support an indication of bacteraemia, comparable efficacy in patients with and\nwithout bacteraemia should be demonstrated. Few patients with bacteraemia at baseline receiving\nmeropenem-vaborbactam (n=12) were included in study 505. Furthermore, due to the design and\nlimited number of patients in study 506, no reliable conclusions can be drawn on efficacy in patients\nwith bacteraemia not associated with cUTI/AP, cIAI or HAP/VAP caused by CRE.\nOverall, based on all the available data and due to the lack of tissue-specific PKPD targets, it cannot\nbe assumed that adequate concentrations of vaborbactam will be reached at infection sites not\ndiscussed in this application. However, there is a clear need for treatment options for infections\ncaused by CRE. Furthermore, FDA and EMA guidelines acknowledge the difficulties in conducting\nadequate studies to evaluate efficacy and safety of antibiotics in the treatment of such infections. It is\nstressed that, in this case, the totality of the data should be taken into account, and support for a\nbenefit in the treatment of infections caused by multidrug resistance (MDR) will mainly rely on results\nof PKPD analyses. In view of these recommendations, and despite some remaining uncertainties, it is\nconsidered that the available data support the approval of Vaborem. The indication was adjusted to\nensure the appropriate use of Vaborem (i.e. in patients for whom the empirical treatment usually\nrecommended is not considered suitable). In addition, the limitations of the data were included in the\ninformation for healthcare professionals.",

These infections are associated with high morbidity, attributable mortality, an\nincreased duration of hospitalisation and higher healthcare costs (Magiorakos et al., 2017; Wong &\nvan Duin, 2017). As the treatment options for such infections are very limited, there is a need for\neffective treatments for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections.\nBeneficial effects\nIn vitro data and data from animal infection models demonstrated that vaborbactam preserved the\nactivity of meropenem against Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing\nEnterobacteriaceae.\nBoth meropenem and vaborbactam have similar, linear and time-independent pharmacokinetics in the\ntherapeutic dose range. No accumulation occurred after multiple TID dosing in subjects with normal\nrenal function. Both compounds penetrated into ELF. Vaborbactam was not metabolised but excreted\nunchanged in urine. There were no mutual pharmacokinetic interactions between the two compounds.\nNo dose adjustments for hepatic impairment were required. After accounting for renal function, no\ndose adjustments for age, weight, gender or race were required.\nMeropenem-vaborbactam showed high efficacy in the treatment of cUTI, including acute\npyelonephritis. Non-inferiority to piperacillin/tazobactam was demonstrated in a randomised, double-\nblind, double-dummy, non-inferiority study.\nFindings from a small Phase 3, randomised, open-label trial of meropenem-vaborbactam versus best\navailable therapy (BAT) suggested a benefit of meropenem-vaborbactam in the treatment of cUTI,\ncIAI, HABP/VABP and bacteraemia suspected or known to be caused by carbapenem-resistant\nEnterobacteriaceae (CRE). Although this study was not designed for inferential testing, a DSMB\nrecommended early study termination due to evidence of benefit in the meropenem-vaborbactam\ngroup.\nUncertainties regarding beneficial effects\nThe impact of hepatic impairment on vaborbactam PK was not formally studied. However, as\nvaborbactam is almost completely excreted unchanged in urine and has low plasma protein binding,\nhepatic impairment is unlikely to affect its pharmacokinetics.\nStudies 505 and 506 do not allow reliable conclusions on the efficacy and safety of meropenem-\nvaborbactam in the treatment of cUTI/AP, cIAI, HAP/VAP and bacteraemia caused by CRE due to the\nlimited number of patients with these infections included in the studies. Efficacy in these infections is\nassumed based on the efficacy of meropenem monotherapy and PKPD analyses.\nFew patients with bacteraemia at baseline were included in study 505, and the findings in study 506\ncan only be considered suggestive of efficacy of meropenem-vaborbactam in bacteraemia.\nEfficacy and safety of meropenem-vaborbactam in the treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram-\nnegative organisms in adults with limited treatment options other than those evaluated in the current\nSwissPAR\n18 / 20\nSwissmedic \u2022 Hallerstrasse 7 \u2022 3012 Bern \u2022 www.swissmedic.ch \u2022 Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 \u2022 Fax +41 58 462 02 12\napplication cannot be assumed due to the uncertainties related to PK and PKPD analyses and the\nlack of efficacy data.\nUnfavourable effects\nDose adjustments are required for renal function.\nMeropenem/vaborbactam caused a concentration-dependent QTc prolongation. The simulations of\nvaborbactam exposure in patients with different degrees of renal impairment after the proposed\ndosing regimen indicated that patients with ESRD or severe renal impairment may reach\nvaborbactam Cmax values that cause QTc prolongation despite the dose adjustments.\nThe safety profile of meropenem is already well-established. The most frequently observed AEs\nincluded headache, diarrhoea, infusion-site phlebitis and nausea. Regarding the safety profile of\nmeropenem-vaborbactam, no major differences to the comparator arms or to meropenem\nmonotherapy were observed.\nUncertainties regarding unfavourable effects\nThere remains some uncertainty regarding the safety profile of meropenem-vaborbactam, as the\nsafety database is not large enough to capture less frequent adverse events (AEs).\nConclusions\nThere were no major issues associated with meropenem/vaborbactam pharmacokinetics and\npharmacodynamics. The simulated dosing recommendations for patients with impaired renal function\nindicated a high probability of target attainment across all renal function groups, even for problematic\nbacteria like Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\nEfficacy and safety of meropenem-vaborbactam in the treatment of cUTI/AP, cIAI, HAP/VAP caused\nby CRE and bacteraemia associated with one of these infections can be assumed based on the\nefficacy and safety of meropenem monotherapy and the available preclinical, PK and PKPD data for\nmeropenem-vaborbactam. This was not fully confirmed by efficacy and safety data due to the limited\nnumber of patients with these infections included in the submitted studies.\nHowever, based on the totality of the data, and in view of the need for treatment options for patients\nwith infections caused by CRE and the difficulties of evaluating efficacy and safety in these relatively\nrare infections, Vaborem can be approved. The uncertainties regarding the data are included in the\ninformation for healthcare professionals.",

Genes encoding \u03b2-\nlactamases may be present on the bacterial chromosome, and are also often found on mobile genetic\nelements such as plasmids and transposons, allowing for both horizontal and vertical genetic\ntransmission (Wong & van Duin, 2017).

The first vaccination with V114 or PCV 13\nwas followed by the second vaccination with PPV23 1 year later.\nThe safety findings following the first vaccination with PCV are part of the integrated safety analysis.\nThe second vaccination with PPV23 was well tolerated. The proportions of participants with AEs\n(injection-site, systemic, and vaccine-related AEs) were generally comparable between the groups.\nA trend towards lower proportions of participants with AEs was observed in older age groups (65 to\n74, and \u226575 years of age) compared with the younger age group (50 to 64 years of age).\nThe proportions of participants who experienced SAEs were low and comparable. None of the SAEs\nwere considered by the investigator to be related to the study vaccine. No participants died during the\nstudy.\nIn Study 021 V114 was administered concomitantly with influenza vaccine in healthy adults 50 years\nof age or older.\nConcomitant and non\u2013concomitant intervention groups had comparable proportions of participants\nwith AEs, injection-site AEs, systemic AEs, and vaccine-related systemic AEs. There was no\ndifference in results if prior PPV23 vaccination was considered. The results were also consistent with\nfindings from other studies in pneumococcal vaccine-na\u00efve adults \u2265 50 years of age.\nHowever, there were more SAEs in the concomitant vaccination group. In particular, more patients\ndeveloped cardiac disorders: 1.2% vs 0.2% (8 vs. 1 cases), of which 1 was fatal, in the concomitant\ngroup. None of the cardiac disorders (congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and coronary\nartery disease) were considered vaccine-related by the investigator.\nIn supportive Study 007 adults \u2265 65 years previously vaccinated with PPV23 received a single dose of\nV114 or PCV13\nThe proportions of participants with AEs, systemic AEs, and vaccine-related systemic AEs were\ngenerally comparable in both intervention groups. The proportion of participants with injection-site\nAEs was higher following vaccination with V114 compared with PCV13. The difference was generally\ndue to higher proportions of participants with solicited injection-site pain and injection-site swelling in\nthe V114 group. These differences were not considered clinically meaningful, as the majority of the\nAEs were transient and mild in intensity.\nNo participants in the V114 group experienced an SAE. Also, no participants died during the study.\nNo difference could be observed based on the time since the PPV23 vaccination (within or over 3\nyears).",

The clinical development programme of\nVaxneuvance (V114) was built on comparative immunology, which is acceptable.\nStudy V114-019 was considered the pivotal study that tested the non-inferiority of the common\nserotypes (STs) and superiority of the unique STs (and ST3) between V114 and a 13-valent\nconjugated pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13). All other studies were descriptive and not powered to\ndemonstrate differences in opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) and/or IgG responses across vaccination\ngroups, and thus are considered supportive for the application.\nSupportive studies investigated:\n\u2022 Lot-to-lot consistency and safety and immunogenicity of vaccine-na\u00efve, healthy adults \u2265 50\nyears (Study V114-020)\n\u2022 Safety and immunogenicity of PPV23 vaccination 1 year after V114 in healthy adults \u2265 50\nyears (Study V114-016)\n\u2022 Safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of V114 and PCV13 in adults \u2265 65 years\npreviously vaccinated with PPV23 (Study V114-007)\n\u2022 Safety and immunogenicity of V114 when administered concomitantly with influenza vaccine\nin healthy adults \u2265 50 years (Study V114-021)\n\u2022 Safety and immunogenicity of adults with risk factors for pneumococcal disease vaccinated\nwith V114 or PCV13 followed by PPV23 six months later (Study V114-017)\n\u2022 Safety and immunogenicity of adults \u226518 years of age with HIV infection (Study V114-018)\nStudy V114-019 was a randomised, active-controlled, parallel-group, modified double-blind study of\nV114 in adults 50 years of age or older conducted in 5 countries (USA, Canada, Japan, Spain, and\nTaiwan). This study was a modified double-blind study as the study personnel administering the\nvaccines were unblinded, while the participant and the investigator involved in the assessment\nremained blinded.\nOne Protocol Amendment was issued on 13 February 2020, 6 weeks before the study completion\ndate (30 March 2020). It added a secondary objective to demonstrate superiority for serotype 3 based\non the OPA geometric mean titres (GMTs) and the proportion of participants with a \u22654-fold rise from\npre-vaccination to 30 days post-vaccination. It also revised the statistical criterion for the evaluation of\nsuperiority for serotypes 22F and 33F to be >0.1 rather than >0 for the difference in proportions of\nparticipants with a \u22654-fold rise from pre-vaccination to 30 days post-vaccination for serotype-specific\nOPA responses (V114 - PCV13).\nEligible participants were healthy males or females \u226550 years without a history of invasive\npneumococcal disease or prior administration of any pneumococcal vaccine. According to the\ninclusion criteria, any underlying chronic condition(s) had to be stable according to the investigator\u2019s\njudgment. Subjects with a history of IPD or a known history of other culture-positive pneumococcal\ndisease within 3 years of Visit 1 were excluded. Other main exclusion criteria were: impairment of\nimmunological function, receipt of any pneumococcal vaccine or expected to receive any\npneumococcal vaccine during the study outside of the protocol, receipt of systemic corticosteroids\nexceeding physiologic replacement doses within 14 days before vaccination, and receipt of\nimmunosuppressive therapy.\nEligible participants were randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1 to a single dose of V114 or PCV 13. The\nvaccines were administered into the muscle.\nRandomisation was stratified by participant age (50 to 64 years, 65 to 74 years, and \u226575 years). At\nleast 800 participants \u2265 65 years of age were planned.\nA total of 1,205 participants were randomised across 30 study sites, of whom 98% completed the\nstudy. Major protocol deviations were reported in 29 participants (2.4%).\nDemographic characteristics were comparable for both groups. The median age of participants was\n66 years (range: 50 to 92 years), with approximately 69% of participants 65 years of age or older\n(n=830), and approximately 12% over 75 years of age.\nThe majority of participants were female (57%), white (68%), and of non-Hispanic or Latino ethnicity\n(78%).\nBaseline characteristics, medical history, prior medication, and concomitant medication were\ncomparable in both groups.\nThe primary immunogenicity analyses were conducted using the per-protocol (PP) population, which\nwas defined as all randomised participants without protocol deviations that could have substantially\nimpacted the results of the immunogenicity analyses. Supportive immunogenicity analyses were\nconducted for the primary immunogenicity endpoint using the full analysis set (FAS) population. This\napproach was acceptable.\nPrimary immunogenicity endpoints\nV114 met non-inferiority criteria for the 13 shared serotypes as assessed by serotype-specific OPA\nGMTs at 30 days post-vaccination with the lower bound of the 95% CI of the estimated OPA GMT\nratio (V114/PCV13) >0.5 for all shared serotypes.\nV114 met superiority criteria for the 2 unique serotypes as assessed by serotype-specific OPA GMTs\nat 30 days post-vaccination with the lower bound of the 95% CI of the estimated OPA GMT ratio\n(V114/PCV13) >2.0. Superiority criteria for the 2 unique serotypes were also met when assessed by\nthe proportions of participants with a \u22654-fold rise from pre-vaccination to 30 days post-vaccination for\nserotype-specific OPA responses. Also, the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the difference in\npercentages [V114-PCV13] was >10% for both unique serotypes.\nSecondary immunogenicity endpoints\nV114 met the superiority criterion for serotype 3 as assessed by the OPA GMTs at 30 days post-\nvaccination with the lower bound of the 95% CI of the OPA GMT ratio (V114/PCV13) >1.2.\nThe superiority criterion for serotype 3 was also met if assessed by the proportion of participants with\na \u22654-fold rise from pre-vaccination to 30 days post-vaccination for OPA responses. The lower bound\nof the 2-sided 95% CI of the difference in percentages [V114- PCV13] was >0%.\nNotably, the superiority criterion lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the OPA GMT ratio [V114/\nPCV13] >1.2 for ST3 is a rather low value and not scientifically established. The clinical relevance of\nthe superior immunogenicity for ST3 remains unclear.\nRelevant subgroup analysis:\nAge\nWithin the pre-defined age subgroups (50 to 64, 65 to 74, and \u2265 75 years of age) serotype-specific\nOPA GMT ratios at 30 days post-vaccination were consistent with the ratios observed for the overall\npopulation. However, there was a trend towards lower values in older patients (\u2265 65 years of age).\nImmunogenicity results were also analysed in all participants \u2265 65 years of age. In this analysis, V114\nmet non-inferiority criteria for the 13 shared serotypes and met superiority criteria for the 2 unique\nserotypes. The superiority criteria for the 2 unique serotypes were also met based on the proportions\nof participants with a \u22654-fold rise of serotype-specific OPA responses 30 days post-vaccination. Thus,\nthe findings are consistent with the overall results.\nHowever, OPA GMTs for ST4 and 19A after PCV15 vaccination were numerically lower compared to\nPCV13.\nTable 2 in the information for healthcare professionals presents the serotype-specific OPA GMTs at\n30 days post-vaccination for pneumococcal vaccine-na\u00efve subjects over 65 years of age.\nV114-020 (PNEU-TRUE) was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active comparator-\ncontrolled, lot-to-lot consistency study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V114\nin healthy pneumococcal vaccine-na\u00efve adults 50 years of age or older.\nEligible participants were randomly assigned in a 3:3:3:1 ratio to 1 of 4 intervention groups (3 different\nlots of V114 and PCV13.\nRandomisation was stratified by participant age at enrolment (50 to 64 years, 65 to 74 years, and\n\u226575 years). Similarly to Study 019, this was also a modified double-blind study as the study personnel\nadministering the vaccines were unblinded. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were mainly similar to\nthe pivotal study.\nA total of 2,340 participants were randomised across 55 study sites. Demographic characteristics\nwere generally comparable for vaccinated participants across intervention groups. The median age of\nparticipants was 65.0 years (range: 50 to 92 years). Approximately 55% of participants were\n\u226565 years of age, and approximately 10% of participants were \u226575 years of age. The majority of\nparticipants were female, white, and of non-Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.\nThe 3 lots of V114 met equivalence criteria, as assessed by the serotype-specific OPA GMTs for the\n15 serotypes in V114 at 30 days post-vaccination. For each pairwise lot-to-lot comparison, the lower\nand upper limits of the 95% CI of the GMT ratios were within the range of 0.5 to 2.0 for all 15\nserotypes in V114.\nInter-group comparisons of IgG GMCs at 30 days post-vaccination with V114 (Lot 1, Lot 2, Lot 3)\nwere consistent with the primary analysis of OPA GMTs.\nSerotype-specific IgG GMCs at 30 days post-vaccination were comparable in the V114 (combined\nlots) and PCV13 intervention groups for the 13 shared serotypes, and higher following administration\nof V114 compared with PCV13 for the 2 serotypes unique to V114.\nOPA and IgG antibody responses (geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) and proportions of participants\nwith a \u22654-fold rise from pre-vaccination to 30 days post-vaccination with V114 were generally\ncomparable across the 3 V114 lots for all 15 serotypes in V114.\nBased on the ST-specific IgG GMCs and OPA titres at day 30 the combined lots elicited in general a\ncomparable immune response to PCV13. Immune response seemed to be numerically lower for ST1\nand 4 (upper limit of the 2 sided CI not including 1) compared to PCV13, and seems to be numerically\nhigher for ST 3, 6B, 18C, 23 F and as expected for the unique STs 22F and 33F.\nStudy V114- 007 was a randomised, multi-site, double-blind descriptive Phase 2 clinical study\ncomparing the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a single dose of V114 and PCV13 in adults\n65 years of age or older in good health who had been vaccinated previously with PPV23 1 year or\nmore before study entry.\nA total of 253 subjects were randomised in this study (127 in the V114 group and 126 in the PCV13\ngroup). Randomisation was stratified by age (65 to 74 years of age versus \u226575 years of age) and time\nsince prior PPV23 vaccination (1 to 3 years versus >3 years). None of the 253 randomised and\nvaccinated subjects discontinued the study.\nThe demographics and baseline characteristics between the groups were balanced. The median age\nwas 72 years; 30% of the subjects were over 75 years of age.\nIgG and OPA responses were generally similar for shared serotypes in subjects administered V114\nas compared to PCV13 recipients. Similarly to previous studies, the OPA responses for ST4 and 5\nwere numerically lower for V114. In case of ST3, 18C a stronger OPA response could be observed for\nV114 compared to PCV13. In general, higher IgG and OPA antibody responses were observed in the\nolder age group with longer time since PPV23 and primarily in the V114 group.\nStudy V114-016 was a randomised, multicenter, double-blind descriptive Phase 3 active comparator-\ncontrolled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V114 followed by a\nPNEUMOVAX\u212223 one year later in healthy adults 50 years of age or older.\nA total of 652 participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either V114 or Prevnar 13\u2122 on\nDay 1 and PPV23 at Month 12. Randomization was stratified by age (50 to 64 years, 65 to 74 years,\nand 75 years or older. The majority of participants completed the study. Notably, participants could\nhave been considered as having completed the study without receipt of PPV23.\nDemographic characteristics were generally comparable for vaccinated participants across\nintervention groups. The median age of participants was 65 years (range: 50 to 90 years).\nApproximately 12% of participants were \u226575 years of age.\nSerotype-specific OPA GMTs at 30 days following vaccination with PPV23 (Month 13) were\ncomparable between participants administered V114 or PCV13 12 months prior to receipt of PPV23\nfor all 15 serotypes in V114. IgG GMCs were consistent with the primary analysis of the OPA GMTs.\nFor several STs the OPA GMTs at Month 13 were lower compared to 30 days following PCV\nvaccination (as in both vaccine groups for 6A, 6B) and similar for most STs.\nStudy V114-021(PNEU-FLU) was a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V114 when administered\nconcomitantly with influenza vaccine in healthy adults 50 years of age or older.\nSubjects with a history of IPD, prior PCV vaccination, prior PPV23 vaccination within 1 year, or with\nimmunosuppressed conditions were excluded.\nParticipants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either V114 with concomitant quadrivalent\ninfluenza vaccine (QIV) or V114 with non-concomitant QIV. Randomisation was stratified by age (50\nto 64 years, 65 to 74 years, and 75 years or older) and by history of prior PNEUMOVAX\u212223\nvaccination.\nOf the 1,200 randomised participants, 97.2% completed the study. Demographics and baseline\ncharacteristics including medical history/medications were generally comparable across intervention\ngroups. The median age was 65 years. Overall, 20.9% of participants reported prior administration of\nPPV23.\nPrimary immunogenicity analyses were conducted using the per-protocol population, which was\nassessed as acceptable.\nSerotype-specific OPA responses 30 days following vaccination with V114 were non-inferior in the\nconcomitant group compared with the non-concomitant group based on the analysis of GMT ratios\n(lower limit of 95% CI >0.50) for all STs. Although the pre-specified non-inferiority criteria were fulfilled\nfor all STs, the OPA GMTs in the concomitant group were lower for almost all STs (with the exception\nof ST19F). The clinical relevance of this observation is not clear.\nStrain-specific haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) GMTs at 30 days post-vaccination were non-inferior\nin the concomitant group compared with the non-concomitant group, as the HAI GMT ratios were\nabove the non-inferiority criteria of the lower limit of 95% CI >0.50.\nOne of the secondary endpoints also evaluated the proportions of participants with an HAI titre \u22651:40\nat 30 days post-vaccination with QIV. The rates of subjects with an HAI titre over 1:40 were similar\nbetween the groups.",
        "summary": "The efficacy of Vaxneuvance is based on results from a study with 1,205 subjects over the age of 50 who had no prior history of pneumococcal infections or vaccines.

        "full-text": "Streptococcus pneumonia, or pneumococcus, causes community-acquired pneumonia, otitis media,\nsinusitis, and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), such as bacteraemia, sepsis, or meningitis.\nPneumococcal infections and IPDs are among the major causes of morbidity and mortality in Europe\nand globally, despite available antibiotic treatments. The disease burden is highest in infants/toddlers\nand in the elderly over 65 years of age. Apart from age, other factors such as immune deficiencies\n(e.g. HIV infection), chronic diseases, smoking, and alcohol abuse increase the risk of pneumococcal\ndisease.\nMore than 90 Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes are classified based on the polysaccharide\ncapsule. The distribution and prevalence of the serotypes (STs) differ across geographic areas and\nseasons.\nCurrently, 2 pneumococcal vaccines are available in Switzerland. A 13-valent conjugated\npneumococcal vaccine (PCV13) is approved for infants from 6 weeks to children 5 years of age for\nthe prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease, pneumonia, and otitis media. During the review\nprocess a variation for adults \u2265 65 years of age was also approved. The second available vaccine is\nthe polysaccharide vaccine containing 23 STs, which is approved for active immunisation against\npneumococcal disease for subjects over 2 years of age with risk factors.\nThis application concerns a 15-valent PCV including STs 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A,\n19F, 22F, 23F, and 33F. The two subtypes 22F and 33F are the additional STs in comparison to the\nalready authorised PCV13. However, these STs are included in the 23-valent polysaccharide\npneumococcal vaccine.\nHigher-valency PCVs might provide better coverage of the pneumococcal diseases compared with\nPCV13; however, the clinical benefit is highly dependent on the local epidemiological situation.\nWith an annual incidence of approximately 10 cases per 100,000 individuals for IPD alone,\npneumococcus remains an important cause of vaccine-preventable infections in Switzerland. The\nimpact of the infant immunisation programme has reduced most of the vaccine-type IPD cases in the\nvaccinated population. However, the rate of IPD in the elderly remained stable until the COVID-19\npandemic.\nThe most common STs responsible for IPD are ST8, ST3, ST23B, 22F, and 9N. Between 2013 and\n2021 ST22F was responsible for 5-11% of the analysed IPD cases. Between 2020 and 2021 this rate\nwas 7%. ST33F was found in fewer cases: around 2% between 2017 and 2021.\nThe clinical development of PCV15 is based on the comparable immunogenicity with PCV13. It aims\nto demonstrate non-inferiority of the immune response to 13 shared serotypes and superiority to 2\nunique serotypes. Clinical efficacy against pneumococcal disease in adults \u2265 65 years can be\nextrapolated from the CAPiTA study conducted with PCV13 (\u201cPCV13 was effective in preventing\nvaccine-type pneumococcal, bacteremic, and nonbacteremic community-acquired pneumonia and\nvaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease but not in preventing community-acquired pneumonia\nfrom any cause.\u201d2)\nThe proposed indication was \u201cfor active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease and\npneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults 18 years of age and older\u201d. The applicant\nrequested a marketing authorisation in accordance with Art. 13 TPA, with the EMA as the reference\nauthority. At the time of submission, the comparator product PCV13, was not approved for the\nproposed age indication in Switzerland, and the indications approved by EMA and FDA differ slightly.\nFor these reasons, a full clinical review took place.\nPivotal Study 019 enrolled healthy pneumococcal vaccine-na\u00efve adults 50 years of age and older with\nstable underlying conditions who did not have history of IPD and were not immunosuppressed.\nThe study met its primary endpoints. It demonstrated non-inferiority for the common STs and\nsuperiority for the 2 unique STs based on the OPA GMT ratios at Day 30 post-vaccination. The non-\ninferiority margin was not justified (the lower limit of the 95% CI for the GMT ratio >0.5). However, it is\ncommonly used in vaccine studies for regulatory approval and thus can be accepted.\nNotably, 7 of the common STs (1, 4, 5,7F, 9V, 14, 19A, 19F) in PCV15 elicited numerically lower OPA\nGMTs compared to PCV13. On the other hand, the immune response to ST3 was higher. Although\nST3 is one of the most common causes of breakthrough infection after PCV 13 vaccination, the\nclinical relevance of the higher OPA GMTs is not known.\nStudy 019 also provided evidence in participants 65 years of age and older. PCV15 met non-inferiority\ncriteria for the 13 shared serotypes and met superiority criteria for the 2 serotypes unique to PCV15,\n2 Bonten et al N Engl J Med 2015; 372:1114-1125\nas assessed by serotype-specific OPA GMT ratios at 30 days post-vaccination, consistent with results\nobserved in the overall population. This analysis was pre-specified in the country-specific study\namendment for Japan as requested by the Pharmaceuticals and Medicinal Devices Agency (PMDA).\nSupportive Study 020 evaluated lot consistency and immunogenicity (ST specific OPA GMTs and IgG\ngeometric mean concentration (GMCs)) of the 3 combined lots for PCV15 and PCV 13 in healthy\npneumococcal vaccine-na\u00efve adults 50 years of age or older. The study was descriptive, thus no\nstrong conclusion on the comparability can be drawn.\nStudy 016 showed a similar immune response in adults \u2265 50 years who were vaccinated with PPV23\n1 year after the initial vaccination with PCV15 or PCV13.\nAnother descriptive study (007) reported the immune response after previous vaccination with PPV23\nin healthy adults \u2265 65 years.\nIn Study 021 the co-administration of a quadrivalent split, inactivated influenza vaccine with PCV15 in\nadults over 50 years of age induced similar immunogenicity compared to non-concomitant\nvaccination.\nStudy 017 showed a similar immune response in adults 18 to 49 years of age with risk factors for\npneumococcal disease vaccinated with PCV15 and PCV13 followed by PPV3 6 months later.\nStudy 018 assessed the immunogenicity of PCV15 in pneumococcal vaccine-na\u00efve adults \u226518 years\nof age with HIV infection (CD4+ T-cell count \u226550 cells/\u03bcL).\nPivotal Study 019 in pneumococcal-na\u00efve healthy adults \u2265 50 years is the only study that tested the\nnon-inferiority for the common STs and superiority of the unique STs between V114 and PCV 13. All\nother studies were descriptive, and were not powered to investigate non-inferiority or superiority.\nComparable immunogenicity was therefore only demonstrated for adults \u2265 50 years.\nThe superiority analysis of ST3 as a secondary endpoint was added to the protocol late in the study,\njust 6 weeks before study completion. Furthermore, the superiority margin was low and not\nestablished in medical science (the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the OPA GMT ratio > 1.2).\nThe applicant explained that the superiority analysis of ST3 including chosen margin was added at\nthe request of the FDA. Taking the FDA request into consideration, inclusion of the superiority results\nin the information for healthcare professionals was accepted, provided the exact margins are\ndescribed.\nAlthough the above-detailed non-inferiority and superiority were met in the pre-specified sub-group\nanalysis in elderly subjects \u2265 65 years, there was a trend towards numerically lower serotype-specific\nOPA GMTs in older subjects (65 to 74 and \u226575 years of age) compared with the younger age group\n(50 to 64 years of age). The clinical implication of these findings is unknown.\nOverall, the immunogenicity data without an established correlate of protection are not sufficient to\nallow a conclusion on the protective clinical effect. Clinical efficacy can only be extrapolated for adults\n\u2265 65 years based on the results of the CAPiTA study, showing less VT IPD and VT after vaccination\nwith PCV13. As no clinical efficacy data are available for adults < 65 years, further justification was\nrequested to support indication below 65 years of age. The responses have not provided relevant\nadditional data confirming efficacy in these subjects, thus the indication has been restricted to adults\n\u2265 65 years.\nFurther limitations of the clinical development include a lack of data on the immune response in\nsubjects with non-stable medical conditions, immunosuppression, or immunodeficiency other than\nHIV.\nSeveral supportive studies provide descriptive results on the immune response in different age\ngroups, special populations, with sequential administration of PPV23, and with co-administration of\ninfluenza vaccine. These descriptive data suggest that PCV15 may induce a weaker immune\nresponse for ST4 compared to PCV13.\nImmune persistence data are limited to 1 study (Study 016). In this study OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs\nwere lower 12 months post-vaccination compared to 30 days post-vaccination, but higher than at\nbaseline and similar for PCV13 and PCV15 vaccines. There is a lack of longer-term immune\npersistence results.\nThe effect of co-administration was only evaluated for influenza vaccine (QIV). Although non-inferior\nimmunogenicity was shown, the OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs were lower for several STs in the co-\nvaccination group, which must be mentioned in the information for healthcare professionals.\nA total of 5,630 subjects received PCV 15 in the submitted studies. PCV15 consistently induced a\nhigher rate of solicited AEs, including injection-site and systemic reactions, compared to PCV13.\nReactogenicity decreased with age, as is usually seen with other vaccines. Importantly, the proportion\nof participants, who experienced SAEs was low and comparable in both vaccine groups. None of the\nSAEs were considered by the investigator to be vaccine-related. There were few deaths in either\nvaccine group; none were considered by the investigator to be vaccine-related.\nThe safety profile was consistent in special populations investigated in the supportive studies (HIV-\ninfected subjects, subjects 18-49 years of age, and subjects previously vaccinated with PPV23).\nSafety following subsequent PPV23 vaccination after a PCV15 dose (8 weeks in HIV-positive\nsubjects, 6 months in subjects 18-49 years old, and 1 year later in healthy adults 50 years of age or\nolder) was comparable to the safety observed for PCV13.\nSafety was not assessed in elderly subjects with risk factors, in subjects with unstable underlying\nmedical conditions, or in subjects with immunosuppression/severe immunodeficiency other than HIV.\nIn addition, very limited safety data were available for pregnant women, and no safety data were\navailable for breastfeeding women.\nThe data submitted demonstrated that PCV15 is immunogenic in the elderly population with stable\nunderlying disease. The non-inferior immunogenicity compared to PCV13 is considered proven for\nadults over 50 years of age. Thus, the clinical efficacy of PCV13 which is established for adults over\n65 years of age can also be expected with PCV15 for the same age group. However, no conclusion\non the additional STs (22F and 33F) can be drawn regarding clinical benefit. In addition, in the lack of\nefficacy data for the younger adults below 65 years of age no firm conclusion can be drawn regarding\nthe clinical benefit of Vaxneuvance in adults 50-65 years of age. For adults below 50 years of age no\nstatistically confirmed comparability to PCV13 could be demonstrated as the studies were descriptive,\nnot designed to test hypothesis. Furthermore, clinically proven efficacy/effectiveness data for this age\ngroup were not available. In the lack of an identified correlate of protection for pneumococcal disease\nin adults, the immunogenicity data do not directly support a clinical benefit.\nThe safety profile of PCV15 is acceptable, although the vaccine is more reactogenic compared to\nPCV13.\nIn conclusion, the data only result in a positive benefit-risk assessment for adults \u2265 65 years",
        "summary": "In all studies performed with Vaxneuvance that were submitted for the marketing authorisation, a total of 5,630 subjects received Vaxneuvance. The pivotal study with 1,205 subjects demonstrated a similar immune response to that after vaccination with PCV13. For adults over the age of 65, another study with PCV13 (CAPiTA study) showed that this immune response is associated with a prevention of the diseases. Therefore, in adults over the age of 65 after being vaccinated with Vaxneuvance, sufficient protection from diseases caused by pneumococci can also be assumed.\nNo clinical data of this kind are available for adults under the age of 65. Therefore, the indication was restricted accordingly in terms of age.\nTaking all the risks and precautions into account, and based on the available data, the benefits of Vaxneuvance outweigh the risks. Swissmedic has therefore authorised the medicinal product Vaxneuvance (a pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine, 15-valent, adsorbed) for use in Switzerland.",

        "full-text": "Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a common commensal bacterium and opportunistic\npathogen. Asymptomatic nasopharyngeal colonisation is common and ranges from 20 to 40% in\nchildren and from 5 to 10% in adults. While carriage is typically asymptomatic, pneumococcus can\ncause a variety of infections including otitis media, sinusitis, and pneumonia. Invasive pneumococcal\ndisease (IPD) occurs when pneumococcus enters normally sterile tissue sites, such as the\nbloodstream or cerebrospinal fluid, leading to septicaemia, meningitis, or bacteraemic pneumonia.\nOther, less frequent infections include periorbital cellulitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, pericarditis,\nperitonitis, pyogenic arthritis, soft tissue infections, and neonatal septicaemia.\nRates of IPD are highest in children under 2(-5) years old, adults over 65 years of age, and\n(especially) individuals with certain chronic health conditions including chronic pulmonary/heart/lung\ndisease, diabetes, splenic dysfunction, immunosuppression/immunodeficiencies, cerebrospinal fluid\nleak, Cochlear implant, smoking, or alcoholism. Crowded environments or poor socioeconomic\nconditions are also considered risk factors.\nIn Switzerland, approximately 80% of fatal pneumococcal infections occur in adults aged 65 years\nand older.1\nPneumococcal infections are treated with antibiotics and the choice of antibiotic should reflect local\nresistance patterns and national treatment guidelines.\nThe polysaccharide (PS) capsule of pneumococci is an important virulence factor, which protects the\norganism from phagocytes.\nOver 90 pneumococcal serotypes have been described based on the different capsule antigens. The\nprevalence and distribution of invasive serotypes differs across populations and geographic areas.\nPrevention of pneumococcal disease in adults includes vaccination with PCVs and PPVs and the\nprophylactic use of antibiotics in special populations. The mechanism of action of all licensed\npneumococcal vaccines is the induction of protective, serotype-specific, anticapsular antibodies.\nPneumococcal vaccines have demonstrated efficacy and effectiveness against invasive disease\ncaused by the serotypes contained in those vaccines in both children and adults. Recommendations\nfor pneumococcal vaccination in adults are typically based on age or risk for pneumococcal disease.\nChildhood immunisation against S. pneumoniae is the most effective public health measure for\npreventing IPD among both vaccine recipients (direct effect) and unvaccinated populations (indirect\n\u2018herd\u2019 effect) as children are the main reservoir, thus unvaccinated populations benefit from the\nreduction or even removal of the vaccine serotypes (VTs) in children.\nIn Switzerland, the Federal Commission for Vaccinations recommends pneumococcal vaccination for\nchildren under 5 and for older children and adults with health conditions with a high risk of an invasive\npneumococcal disease. Vaccination of healthy adults over 65 years of age was not recommended at\nthe time of this assessment.\nWith an annual incidence of approximately 10 cases per 100 000 individuals for IPD alone,\npneumococcus remains an important cause of vaccine-preventable infections in Switzerland.1\nIn Switzerland, the impact of the infant immunisation programme has reduced most of the vaccine-\ntype IPD cases in the vaccinated population; however, the rate of IPD in the elderly remained stable\n(until the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions were implemented.)\nThere is no immunological threshold level of antibody concentration that correlates with protection\nagainst pneumococcal disease in adults. Opsonophagocytic antibodies are surrogate markers for\nvaccine efficacy against pneumococcal disease and have been shown to correlate with vaccine-\ninduced protection. Due to the difficulties in conducting an efficacy study with the PCVs, an\nimmunobridging approach is acceptable to consider licensure.\n1 Zens KD, Baroutsou V, Fehr JS and Lang P (2022) Pneumococcal Vaccination Coverage and Uptake Among Adults in Switzerland: A\nNationwide Cross-Sectional Study of Vaccination Records.

        "summary": "Vaccines such as Vaxneuvance protect against infectious diseases by inducing the immune system to produce more antibodies or certain immune cells. The immune system recognises parts of the bacterium contained in Vaxneuvance as foreign and create antibodies against them. When exposed to the bacterium again, the immune system can then produce antibodies more quickly.\nVaxneuvance contains polysaccharides (special sugars) from the capsule of the pneumococcal bacterium (Streptococcus pneumoniae). There are more than 90 different types (serotypes) of this bacterium. Vaxneuvance uses the polysaccharides from 15 serotypes. To make these polysaccharides more easily recognisable for the immune system, and thereby elicit a good immune response, they are attached to (conjugated with) a protein from another bacterium.\nUnlike the pneumococcal vaccine Prevenar 13 (PCV13) already authorised in Switzerland and containing 13 serotypes, Vaxneuvance also uses an additional 2 serotypes (22F and 33F).",

        "full-text": "The efficacy of remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19 was evaluated in four studies. No Clinical\nStudy Report (CSR) was submitted for any of the studies (Zulassungsauflagen).\nPivotal studies\nCO-US-540-5776 (ACTT-1) was a multicentre, adaptive, randomised, double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in hospitalised patients with COVID-\n19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection. Disease severity ranged from mild/moderate to\nsevere/critically ill.\nSubjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either remdesivir at 200 mg IV loading dose on\nDay 1 followed by 100 mg once-daily IV maintenance dose while hospitalised for up to a 10 days, or\nmatching placebo at the same dose and schedule. Both treatments were given in addition to\nsupportive care according to the standard of care for the trial site hospital. Randomisation was\nstratified by site and severity of illness at enrolment:\nsevere disease: requiring mechanical ventilation, requiring oxygen, oxygen saturation\nSpO2 \u2264 94% on room air, or tachypnoea [respiratory rate \u2265 24 breaths/min];\nmild-moderate disease: SpO2 > 94% and respiratory rate < 24 breaths/min without supplemental\noxygen).\nResults\nOf the 1063 randomised patients, 541 were assigned to the remdesivir group and 522 to the placebo\ngroup. The mean age of the patients was 58.9 years, with 36.2% aged >65 years, and 64.3% were\nmale. Overall, 53.2% of the patients were white, 20.6% were black, and 12.6% were Asian. Median\ntime (IQR) from symptom onset to randomisation was 9 (6-12) days and comparable between\ntreatment arms. The majority of patients (88.7%) had severe disease. Somewhat more patients in the\nremdesivir group had comorbid conditions known to be risk factors for severe course of disease, most\nnotably coronary artery disease, chronic oxygen requirement, and chronic kidney disease. More\npatients in the placebo group had a score of 7 (hospitalised, receiving invasive mechanical ventilation\nor extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) on the ordinal scale, indicating more severe\ndisease and a higher risk of adverse outcome. At the time of the analysis, less than half of the\npatients in each treatment group received the planned full 10-day treatment course due to recovery,\ndeath, discontinuation, missed doses during treatment and the fact that about 20% of the patients\nwere still receiving treatment. The results may, therefore, not be fully representative of a 10-day\ntreatment duration.\nSuperiority of remdesivir over placebo was demonstrated for the primary and key secondary\nendpoints. Patients in the remdesivir group had a shorter time to recovery than patients in the placebo\ngroup (median, 11 days, as compared with 15 days; rate ratio for recovery 1.32 [1.12 to 1.55];\nP<0.001; 1059 patients). This primary endpoint was in line with the recommendations in the FDA\nguideline, although there is currently no single approved endpoint for the evaluation of efficacy in the\ntreatment of COVID-19. A more objective endpoint such as all-cause mortality would have been\npreferred to rule out any interference of potential problems regarding study conduct. The primary\nendpoint did not take into account durability of recovery.\nFor the primary endpoint, the effect was not consistent across disease severity strata; superiority over\nplacebo was only demonstrated in the stratum of severe disease. There was considerable variation in\ndisease severity in the group of patients categorised as having \u2018severe disease\u2019 (ranging from\nrequiring supplemental oxygen to mechanical ventilation, including ECMO). A statistically significant\nbenefit of remdesivir over placebo in the rate ratio for recovery was only seen in patients with a\nbaseline category 5 score (receiving oxygen). These results should, however, be interpreted with\ncaution, as the study was not powered for such subgroup analyses and no corrections for multiplicity\nwere made. No difference in mortality was observed between the remdesivir and placebo treatment\ngroup.\nTaken together, the results indicate a beneficial effect of remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19.\nThe findings suggest that a benefit may be restricted to patients requiring supplemental oxygen but\nwithout a need for high-flow oxygen, mechanical ventilation or ECMO, which is in line with the\nindication applied for.\nThe results from the ACTT-1 study were not confirmed in another double-blind, randomized, placebo-\ncontrolled trial conducted in China (CO-US-540-5758). This study was terminated before completion,\nbecause of decreasing incidence of COVID-19 in China during the study. No difference in mortality at\nday 28 was seen between remdesivir- and placebo-treatment, however no reliable conclusions can be\ndrawn due to the early termination of the study.\nStudies GS-US-540-5773 and GS-US-540-5774 were two randomised, open-label, multicentre\nstudies to evaluate the efficacy of two remdesivir regimens in participants with severe (GS-US-540-\n5773) or moderate (GS-US-540-5774) COVID-19 infection. In GS-US-540-5773, standard of care\ntherapy together with remdesivir at the dose applied for (single 200 mg IV loading dose on day 1, 100\nmg once-daily IV maintenance dose) for either 5 days or 10 days total treatment duration were\ncompared, while study GS-US-540-5774 compared standard of care (SOC) therapy with remdesivir\nfor 5 or 10 days with standard of care alone.\nThe study enrolled hospitalised patients 18 years of age, or aged \u226512 and <18 years of age weighing\n\u226540 kg with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and with radiographic infiltrates by imaging\nstudy. Furthermore, in GS-US-540-5773, patients with severe disease were enrolled: either SpO2\n\u226494% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen. In GS-US-540-5774, patients with moderate\ndisease were enrolled: SpO2 >94% on room air.\nThe primary endpoint in the studies was clinical status assessed by a 7-point ordinal scale on Day 14\nin GS-US-540-5773 and on Day 11 in GS-US-540-5774. The endpoint was not objective as\ndetermining the score on the ordinal scale partly involved investigators\u2019 individual assessment of\npatient\u2019s clinical status and may also be influenced by hospitals\u2019 procedures for the management and\ndischarge of these patients. Together with the open-label design this might have introduced bias and\nhad an influence on the study outcomes. For both studies, and in particular in patients with more\nsevere COVID-19, it can be questioned whether the time period over which the primary endpoint was\nevaluated was long enough.\nResults GS-US-540-5773\nThe mean age of patients was 60.0 (14.8) years (range 20-98 years), and 63.7% were male. Of note,\nalthough adolescents could be enrolled in the study, no participants <18 years of age were included.\nThe majority of participants was white (70.4%), black (11.2%) or Asian (11.5%). The treatment groups\nwere balanced in terms of demographic characteristics but not baseline disease characteristics.\nGreater proportions of patients in the 10-day group were in the two baseline ordinal scale categories\nindicating most severe disease as compared to the 5-day group. Median time (IQR) from symptom\nonset to start of treatment was 8 (5-11) days and 9 (6-12) days in the 5- and 10-day groups,\nrespectively.\nAfter adjustment for imbalances in baseline clinical status, patients receiving a 10-day course of\nremdesivir had a similar distribution across ordinal categories of clinical status, suggesting that there\nis no difference in the effect of 5- or 10-day treatment. Numerically, patients in the 10-day treatment\ngroup seemed to have worse outcomes as compared to patients in the 5-day treatment group. This\nwas consistent in the secondary endpoints. Because of the uncontrolled, open-label design, this study\nprovides no information on a treatment effect of remdesivir.\nResults GS-US-540-5774\nThe mean age of patients was 56.0 (15.1) years. Slightly more patients \u226575 years of age were\nincluded in the 10-day treatment group. One patient <18 years (12 years old) was included. Of the\nparticipants, 61.1% were male, and 61.3% of the patients were white, 18.5% were black, and 19.1%\nwere Asian. Median time (IQR) from symptom onset to start of treatment was 8 (5-11) days and\ncomparable across treatment groups. A slight imbalance in baseline disease characteristics was\nseen, as more patients in the SOC group required high- or low-flow oxygen.\nThere was a statistically significant difference in the distribution in clinical status at Day 11, indicating\na benefit of remdesivir in participants receiving a 5-day course of remdesivir compared with those\nreceiving SOC alone, while participants receiving a 10-day course of remdesivir had a similar\ndistribution as those receiving SOC alone. Numerically, the outcomes in the 10-day treatment group\nseemed to be worse than in the 5-day treatment group, as also seen in study GS-US-540-5774. The\nreasons for this finding are currently unclear. As only 37.8% in the 10-day group received a full course\nof treatment it is questionable whether the data from the 10-day treatment group are representative\nfor 10 days treatment duration. This further complicates the interpretation of the findings.",
        "summary": "The efficacy of Veklury was investigated in three different studies.\nThe largest study comprised 1,062 male and female hospitalised patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. Half of the study participants received a dummy drug (placebo). The other half of the participants received treatment with Veklury. This study showed that the benefit of Veklury was particularly evident in those patients who required supplemental oxygen. The time to recovery was shorter in the severely ill study participants who received Veklury than in those who received placebo. No difference in time to recovery was observed between the Veklury and placebo groups for those patients with mild COVID-19.\nAnother study with almost 400 male and female patients suffering from severe COVID-19 investigated the treatment period with Veklury. No significant difference in efficacy was observed between a treatment with Veklury over 5 days and a treatment with Veklury over 10 days.\nThe third study was conducted with almost 600 male and female patients with mild COVID-19. The participants in this study were investigated in respect of differing treatment periods with Veklury (5 and 10 days) compared to traditional types of treatment. The study investigated the improvement in health after 11 days. Those patients who were treated with Veklury for 5 days recovered sooner. The longer 10-day treatment period with Veklury did not produce any improvement in the time to recovery.",

        "full-text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 can range from mild to severe disease, with the\nmajority (approximately 80%) having mild to moderate disease, including flu-like symptoms up to mild\npneumonia. About 20% of infected patients develop severe to critical disease, with complications\nincluding acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), arrhythmia, septic shock, acute cardiac injury,\nacute coronary syndrome, cardiomyopathy, acute respiratory injury, and acute renal injury (see below\nfor main risk factors for severe disease). At the time of assessment, there were no approved drugs to\ntreat COVID-19 in Switzerland.\nThe pharmacokinetic profiles of remdesivir and its plasma metabolites GS-441524 and GS-704277,\nas well as the PBMC-associated, pharmacologically active metabolite GS-443902 following the\nproposed dosing regimen were characterised in four phase 1 studies.\nNo data on the PK in the target population are available to date. No clinical studies investigating the\nimpact of hepatic and renal impairment on the PK of remdesivir and its metabolites were conducted.\nThe impact of other factors such as race, age, gender or weight on the PK of remdesivir and its\nmetabolites was not evaluated in the context of clinical studies. Furthermore, no population PK\nanalysis was conducted to estimate the variability of the PK of remdesivir based on demographic\nfactors.\nThe dose applied for was selected based on efficacy data from studies in SARS-CoV-2- and MERS-\nCoV-infected rhesus monkeys and PK bridging from animal data to human doses. A potential effect\nfrom SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 on the PK of remdesivir was not taken into account, as no\nPK data in the target population are currently available. Based on the limited available information, it\ncannot be ruled out that another dose regimen might be more efficacious and/or result in a better\nsafety profile.\nThe optimal duration of therapy with remdesivir was not evaluated prior to the start of the clinical\nstudies. 5-day and 10-day treatment durations were compared in studies CO-US-540-5773 and CO-\nUS-540-5774. Results indicated possibly worse outcomes with 10-day treatment duration. The\nreasons for this are currently unclear. However, due to the subjective endpoint used and the open-\nlabel design, no reliable conclusions on the optimal treatment duration can be drawn from these\nstudies.\nSimulations based on the PBPK model suggest that the proposed dose results in similar remdesivir\nand GS-441524 steady-state exposures in adolescents compared to those in adults. However,\nconsidering the shortcomings of the model development and evaluation, this could not be reliably\nconcluded. Furthermore, it is currently unclear whether efficacy data from adults can be extrapolated\nto paediatric patients. As there were no PK or efficacy data available to confirm comparable\nexposures and/or efficacy in adolescents and adult COVID-19 patients at the proposed dose, no dose\nrecommendation for paediatric patients could be provided.\nRemdesivir treatment resulted in a 4-day reduction in time to recovery as compared to placebo\ntreatment in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 infection. Data on efficacy mainly resulted from one\nplacebo-controlled phase 3 study, in which patients received treatment for 10 days. The observed\nshorter time to recovery compared to placebo was mainly driven by the effect in patients with severe\ndisease, and more specifically by patients with baseline category 5 score (receiving oxygen). This\nsame pattern was observed for clinical status at day 15 and mortality at day 14. These results should,\nhowever, be interpreted with caution, as the study was not powered for such subgroup analyses (by\ndisease severity, baseline ordinal scale), and no corrections for multiplicity were made. The results\ncan, at this point be considered suggestive of a beneficial effect in the target population applied for,\nbut ideally would need confirmation from a second adequately designed and conducted randomised\ncontrolled trial.\nRemdesivir treatment was relatively well-tolerated as compared to placebo; Grade 3 and 4 adverse\nevents and (drug-related) serious adverse events occurred at a similar frequency. In addition, in\ncomparison to SOC, no relevant differences were observed.\nNo dedicated in vivo DDI studies were conducted. Overall, the DDI assessment was insufficient.\nThe absence of an unacceptable prolongation in cardiac repolarisation cannot be entirely excluded\nconsidering the lack of a tQT study and the shortcomings of the concentration-QT analysis.\nThe most frequently reported AEs in the RDV group in study CO-US-540-5776 were anaemia or\ndecreased haemoglobin (7.9%, placebo 9.0%); acute kidney injury, decreased estimated glomerular\nfiltration rate or creatinine clearance, or increased blood creatinine (7.4%, placebo 7.3%); pyrexia\n(5.0%, placebo 3.3%); hyperglycaemia or increased blood glucose level (4.1%, placebo 3.3%); and\nincreased aminotransferase levels including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, or\nboth (4.1%, placebo 5.9%).\nThe most frequently reported AEs in the RDV group in studies CO-US-540-5773 and -5774 were\nnausea, diarrhoea, headache, constipation, acute respiratory failure, ALT increased, acute kidney\ninjury, and hypokalaemia.\nAvailable preclinical data indicate a potential risk for renal toxicity. A similar risk in humans cannot be\nruled out.\nThe available data indicate no major safety issues, and adequate warnings are included in the\ninformation for healthcare professionals. More detailed information on the safety profile and tolerability\nof remdesivir will become available when the final CSRs and a final safety analysis of all available\nsafety data from the submitted studies will be provided.\nIn view of the unmet medical need for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, the\nZulassungsauflagen, and the proposed wording in the information for healthcare professionals, the\nclinical pharmacology package was considered acceptable. There remain uncertainties on the\nefficacy and safety of remdesivir treatment because, at this stage, mainly preliminary data are\navailable. Nevertheless, available data indicate a benefit of remdesivir and no major safety issues.\nIt is anticipated that the existing uncertainties can be resolved once more information will become\navailable from final analysis of ongoing studies. Therefore, and in view of the exceptional\ncircumstances due to the current pandemic with a clear unmet medical need, a temporary\nauthorisation in accordance with Art. 9a TPA was granted.\nIn the context of the temporary authorisation in accordance with Art. 9a TPA, several\nZulassungsauflagen were defined. In order to confirm currently available results, the final clinical\nstudy reports of studies CO-US-540-5776, GS-US-540-5773, and GS-US-540-5774 will be submitted.\nThe specific obligations defined by the EMA/CHMP (EMA/357513/2020) regarding these studies were\nfully endorsed, and it is anticipated that the final study reports and the responses to the specific\nobligations will address the existing uncertainties. Therefore, this information was requested to be\nsubmitted to Swissmedic as well. Furthermore, the applicant was asked to critically discuss final\nresults of the Solidarity trial in view of the final outcomes of their submitted studies.",

The VICTORIA study enrolled patients\n\u226518 years of age in the NYHA classes II to IV with an LVEF \u226445% and markedly increased NT-\nproBNP. Qualifying patients had to have a recent HF event (hospitalisation for HF [hHF] within the last\n6 months or intravenous diuretic treatment for HF without hospitalisation within the last 3 months). No\nrestriction to enter the study only after a particular pre-defined delay from the index event (i.e., the\nstudy partially enrolled patients during a hHF prior to discharge). Excluded were unstable patients\n(per protocol defined as administration of any intravenous treatment within the last 24 hours or\nsystolic blood pressure <100 mm Hg or symptomatic hypotension) and patients with interfering\ncardiac (e.g., hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, amyloidosis) and non-cardiac (e.g., kidney\nfailure, severe hepatic impairment, malignancy) comorbidities.\nAll patients received vericiguat or PLB in addition to the standard of care (see Table 2) each titrated\nfrom 2.5 to 5 mg to 10 mg based on systolic blood pressure. Table 1 illustrates the primary and key\nsecondary endpoints of the VICTORIA trial and the statistical methods used. The study was powered\nfor CV mortality, and confirmatory testing had to be terminated if CV mortality in the vericiguat group\nfailed to be superior to that in the PLB group.\nSwissPAR\nTable 1\nSource: SAP Table 1\nOverall, 5050 patients (3842 [76%] males and 1208 [24%] females) were randomised (1:1), of whom\nabout 77% completed the study. All patients randomised were included in the efficacy analysis. The\ndiscontinuation rate of 23% was accounted for almost completely by cases of death during the study\n(alternative reasons made up <1.5% in each treatment arm). The VICTORIA study assessed the vital\nstatus or the primary endpoint for 99.9% of the study participants (i.e. \u2264 0.1% missing data), which\nresulted in an amendment of the statistical analysis plan endorsing the omission of any sensitivity\nanalyses.\nPatient demographics (sex, age, representation of regions, race and ethnicity) and further important\nbaseline characteristics (e.g., NYHA class, qualifying event, renal function, NT-proBNP level, medical\ndisorders in addition to HF, and concomitant medication for HF and other comorbidities) appeared to\nbe well balanced between treatment arms. The study population had a mean age of 67 years and was\nmostly in NYHA class II (~59%) or III (~40%). The mean LVEF was ~29% (nearly 50% had a LVEF\n<30%). The mean eGFR at baseline was ~62 ml/min/1.73m2 (~10% had an eGFR \u226430\nml/min/1.73m2). The mean baseline NT-proBNP levels were 4803.7 pg/ml (vericiguat arm) and 4679.6\npg/ml (PLB arm).\nThe most common qualifying event (nearly 85% of all index events) was hHF typically within three\nmonths prior to randomisation (~66% of all index events). About 11% of these patients were\nrandomised while hospitalised (median time from admission to randomisation 8 days).\nMost frequent medical disorders in addition to HF were hypertension (79.1%), coronary artery disease\n(58.4%), hyperlipidaemia (57.3%), diabetes mellitus (46.9%), atrial fibrillation (45.0%), and prior\nmyocardial infarction (42.1%). The background pharmacotherapy for HF in both arms exemplified in\nTable 2 below was in accordance with the standard of care (SOC) at the time of study launch. Over\n90% of the patients in both arms received a combination of \u22652 HF medications. The proportion of\npatients treated with a combination of three classes (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, any\ninhibitor of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI),\nangiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI)], and beta-\nblocker) was ~60%.\nSwissPAR\nTable 2 Vericiguat PLB\nn % n (%)\n\u22652 SOC Medications\nNo 221 8.8 210 8.3\nYes 2300 91.2 2309 91.7\nMRA + Any RAS Inhibitor 91 3.6 100 4.0\nBeta-Blocker + Any RAS inhibitor 569 22.6 532 21.1\nMRA + Beta-Blocker 160 6.3 148 5.9\nMRA + Beta-Blocker + Any RAS inhibitor 1480 58.7 1529 60.7 Source: CSR Table 10-9\nThe mean treatment duration with the maximum dose of 10 mg vericiguat was 362 days (total days at\nany dose from 2.5 mg \u2013 10 mg: 375.5 days). During the entire course of the trial, >80% of the patients\nreached the target dose of 10 mg vericiguat, and ~62% stayed on this dose until the end of the\ntreatment period. Overall, the mean dose of vericiguat over the course of the study was 7.8 mg.\nVICTORIA met its primary endpoint (composite of CV death and hospitalisation for HF). There was a\nsignificant reduction in the number and rate (per 100 patient-years) of primary endpoint events\nconfirmed by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC) in the vericiguat arm as compared with the PLB\narm, equivalent to a modest 10% relative risk reduction (hazard ratio (HR) [95% CI]: 0.90 [0.82; 0.98];\np=0.019). The absolute risk reduction was 3% and 4.2 events per 100 patient-years.\nTaken from Ref. [7]\nThe treatment effect of vericiguat relative to PLB persisted throughout the study. It should be noted\nthat the relative short median treatment duration of just ~1 year resulted in an undesirably high\nnumber of censored patients (~25% and ~50% at 1 and 2 years, respectively) which may explain\npartial fading of the effect at later time points (failure to meet proportional hazard rule).\nSwissPAR\nKM-Plot for the primary\ncomposite endpoint\n(ITT Population)\nSource: CSR [Figure 11-1]\nBoth components of the primary endpoint contributed to this effect, but none of them showed a\nsignificant reduction in the vericiguat arm despite the fact that (i) the study was powered for CV\nmortality and (ii) the number of patients randomised substantially exceeded the sample size pre-\ndefined per protocol (cf. also secondary outcomes below).\nThe effect of vericiguat on the composite primary endpoint was consistent across most predefined\nsubgroups except for some apparent exceptions, most noticeably patients with very high NT-proBNP\nlevels and LVEF \u226540%.\nTaken from Ref. [7]\nThe point estimates for patients with baseline NT-proBNP \u22645314 pg/mL (quartiles 1, 2, and 3) were\nclearly in favour of vericiguat treatment as opposed to those with baseline NT-proBNP >5314 pg/mL\n(quartile 4), who did not share the benefit from vericiguat treatment (interaction test p-value 0.001). A\ncomprehensive post hoc analysis systematically covering the range of NT-proBNP and including\nmodelling of the HR as a continuous function of NT-proBNP further corroborated a potentially\nSwissPAR\ndetrimental effect of vericiguat in patients with very high NT-proBNP at baseline [8]. Supplemental\npost hoc analyses further revealed that these patients were typically of older age, in higher NYHA\nclasses, and had a lower eGFR than patients who had lower baseline NT-proBNP. Importantly,\npatients with very high NT-proBNP at baseline clustered largely in the subcategory of patients\nrandomised during their index event, i.e. shortly after HF hospitalisation.\nAs one would expect from the above findings, patients who entered the study with a short delay after\nHF hospitalisation (within 1 months) showed no reduction in the composite primary endpoint (HR\n[95% CI] of 1.01 [0.88, 1.16]). Considering all the evidence discussed, one can assume that this\ngroup included a substantial proportion of patients who were not stabilised adequately. In contrast,\npatients entering the study with a longer delay from HF hospitalisation showed a reduction in the\ncomposite primary endpoint (HR [95% CI] of 0.79 [0.64, 0.97], 0.94 [0.71, 1.24], and 0.85 [0.67, 1.07]\nin patients enrolled within 1 - 2, 2 - 3, and 3 - 6 months from HF hospitalisation).\nThe results for the secondary outcomes were generally consistent with those for the primary endpoint.\nThe HRs [95% CI] for CV mortality and first hHF amounted to 0.93 [0.81; 1.06] (p=0.269) and 0.90\n[0.81; 1.00] (p=0.048), respectively.\nThe treatment with vericiguat resulted in a 9% relative risk reduction in the overall events (first and\nrecurrent) of hospitalisation for HF (compared with PLB (HR [95% CI]: 0.91 [0.84-0.99]; p=0.023).\nThere was a minor numerical reduction in all-cause mortality in patients treated with vericiguat (HRs\nSwissPAR\n[95% CI]: 0.95 [0.84-1.07]; p=0.377). Finally, the risk reduction for the exploratory endpoint of CV\nhospitalisation further supports a potential clinical benefit of vericiguat (HR [95% CI]: 0.88 [0.81-0.96]).\nTaken from Ref. [7]",

        "full-text": "Heart failure (HF) is a major concern in public health and associated with considerable morbidity and\nmortality. The 1-year and 5-year mortality rates in patients with chronic HF are ~7% and ~33%,\nrespectively, and acute decompensation of HF has become the leading cause of CV hospitalisations\nin people over 60 years of age. The prognosis gets even worse in patients who have had a\nhospitalisation for HFrEF (5-year mortality rate >75%). The recent addition of SGLT2 inhibitors (e.g.,\ndapagliflozin) to SOC has improved the treatment of patients with HFrEF. Nevertheless, there is a\nmedical need for further treatment options, preferably for those affecting the pathogenesis of HF in a\nmanner different from the currently available treatments.\nBeneficial effects\nThe pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of vericiguat have been thoroughly studied\nin healthy subjects as well as in the intended patient population. Vericiguat has a low potential for\nSwissPAR\npharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. No dose adjustments in subjects with impaired renal (mild to\nsevere) or hepatic function (mild and moderate), or based on demographic factors are required.\nVericiguat reduced (relative risk reduction: 10%) the composite primary endpoint consisting of CV\ndeath and hospitalisation for HF (time to 1st event). The hazard ratio (HR[95% CI]) of the vericiguat\ngroup versus placebo control was 0.90 [0.82; 0.98] (p=0.019). The absolute risk reduction in the\nprimary endpoint was 4.2 events per 100 patient-years. This effect was primarily driven by the\nreduction of HF hospitalisation events (hHF). The HRs [95% CI] for the two components of the\nprimary endpoint were 0.93 [0.81; 1.06] (CV mortality; p=0.269) and 0.90 [0.81; 1.00] (hHF; p=0.048).\nVericiguat also reduced the total HF hospitalisations (first and recurrent events) compared with\nplacebo (HR [95% CI]: 0.91 [0.84-0.99]; p=0.023). There was a minor numerical reduction in all-cause\nmortality (HRs [95% CI]: 0.95 [0.84; 1.07]; p=0.377). Finally, there was a risk reduction for the\nexploratory endpoint CV hospitalisation in vericiguat-treated patients (HR [95% CI]: 0.88 [0.81-0.96]).\nThere is heterogeneity of the treatment benefit depending on baseline NT-proBNP and LVEF with\nimplications for the definition of the target population.\nUncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects\nLack of data in subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or severe hepatic impairment limits the\nuse of vericiguat in these patients. The risk of effects on the QT interval at supratherapeutic\nexposures is unclear due to lack of data. It remains unclear whether vericiguat doses higher than\n10 mg could have yielded more favourable efficacy outcomes.\nThe effect on the primary endpoint was observed for a mean treatment duration of just ~1 year. None\nof the individual components of the primary endpoint showed a statistically significant reduction in the\nvericiguat group of VICTORIA powered for CV mortality.\nCurrently, the additivity of the clinical benefits of vericiguat and SGLT2 inhibitors for patients with\nHFrEF remains unclear.\nUnfavourable effects (risks)\nVericiguat belongs to the relatively new therapeutic group of sGC stimulators. Therefore, knowledge\non its safety profile is still limited. Although its safety profile might be expected to be in line with other\nsGC stimulating agents, the interaction with other therapies used in a CHF population with reduced\nejection fraction and the disease characteristics may complicate the interpretation of the safety profile.\nConclusion\nIn summary, vericiguat treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the primary endpoint\nas compared with placebo control. The robustness of this effect in the overall study population of the\nVICTORIA trial is uncertain (e.g. lack of efficacy in patients with very high NT-proBNP levels and\nLVEF \u226540%). This has been addressed in the revised indication restricted to patients who have been\nstabilised after a HF decompensation event (with the aim of excluding patients with very high NT-\nproBNP levels from treatment) and to patients with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF <40%).\nVarious safety concerns are related to sGC stimulators such as vericiguat, primarily hypotension,\nepisodes of syncope, and anaemia. None of these concerns is considered prohibitive for an approval\nof vericiguat in the revised indication.\nTaken together, the benefit-risk ratio for vericiguat in the target population defined by the adapted\nindication (i.e., patients stabilised adequately after a prior HF decompensation event) can be\nconsidered positive.",

Thus, there is a medical need for novel\ntherapy options in addition to the current standard of care.\nA relative cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) deficit due to dysfunctional nitric oxide (NO)-\ncGMP signalling is thought to play a role in the development and progression of CHF (for review see\n[5, 6]).

It is used to treat adults with chronic heart failure[1] who have been sufficiently stabilised following recent decompensation (marked increase in disease-related symptoms including shortness of breath, swelling of the feet and legs due to accumulation of fluid, and fatigue, requiring administration of an intravenous diuretic[2] \u2013 usually as an inpatient[3]).\nVerquvo is used to reduce the risk of hospital admissions and deaths due to heart failure in these patients. It is used in combination with other therapies for heart failure.\nVerquvo was approved as part of the joint initiative of the Access Consortium. This joint initiative is a collaborative project between the drug regulatory authorities in Australia (Therapeutic Goods Administration, TGA), Canada (Health Canada, HC), Singapore (Health Sciences Authority, HSA), the United Kingdom (Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, MHRA) and Swissmedic and the pharmaceutical industry. The joint initiative coordinates the assessment of authorisation applications for new active substances that have been submitted in at least two of the five countries.\nThe authorisation application for Verquvo was submitted for assessment to the regulatory authorities in Singapore, Australia and Switzerland. Each country assessed a part of the application and then shared and discussed the results. At the end of the process, each authority decided on the application independently.\nFurther details of the Access joint initiative are published on the Swissmedic website. Access Consortium (swissmedic.ch).\n[1] Heart failure: Heart failure is a condition in which the heart muscle is no longer strong enough to pump sufficient blood throughout the body.\n[2] Diuretic: A diuretic is a medicinal product that promotes the excretion of urine.\n[3] Inpatient: An inpatient is someone who needs to stay in a hospital or nursing home for the treatment.\n",

Considering all\naspects of the medical history and the course of the event, the latter case seems unlikely to be\nrelated.\nSAEs (Q4W vs oral SOC)\nSerious adverse events (SAEs) occurred more frequently under the Q4W CAB+RPV treatment\nregimen than under oral SOC through to Week 48 in the FLAIR and ATLAS pool: 10% vs 9%,\nrespectively.\nThis difference through to Week 48 was mainly driven by treatment-naive patients (FLAIR study: 6%\nvs 4% of patients, ATLAS study: 4% vs 5% of patients), but through to Week 100, this difference in\ntreatment-naive FLAIR patients had levelled out (8% vs 8%, Q4W vs SOC).\nDue to the different durations of controlled phases of the FLAIR and ATLAS studies, no Week 100\ncomparison is available for treatment-experienced ATLAS patients.\nThe higher risk for treatment-naive patients in the first year of treatment may be regarded as\nacceptable as no higher risk of fatal SAEs was observed.\nSAEs (Q8W vs Q4W)\nMore SAEs occurred under the Q8W vs the Q4W treatment regimen in the ATLAS-2M study: 5% vs.\n4% of patients, respectively.\nSAEs (Q8W vs oral SOC)\nA post-hoc indirect comparison of the Q8W and QD oral SOC regimens showed that the risk lf SAEs\nis higher for the Q8W treatment regimen than for oral SOC (odds ratio 1.8) (excluding injection site\nreactions). However, the differences between the treatment groups are considered small enough to\nbe acceptable for approval.\nGrade 3-4 AEs (Q4W vs oral SOC):\nMore grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) were observed through to Week 48 in the investigational\ntreatment group than in the control group: 11% versus 6% patients of the pooled FLAIR and ATLAS\nstudies, respectively.\nThrough to Week 100, 14% vs 6% patients of the FLAIR study suffered 3-4 AEs.\nGrade 3-4 AEs (Q8W vs Q4W):\nSimilar proportions of patients in the two long-acting injection treatment groups experienced grade 3-4\nAEs when excluding injections site reactions (4.9% vs 4.6% patients, respectively).\nAEs (Q4W vs oral SOC)\nOverall, the frequency of AEs was distinctly higher in the Q4W CAB+RPV groups than in the control\ngroups on standard oral ART in both pivotal Phase 3 studies, FLAIR (94% vs 80%) and ATLAS (95%\nvs 71%). The picture remained similar after exclusion of the high rates of injection site reactions and\nwas principally consistent over all categories of AEs, including adverse drug reactions. See also Table\n6 in Adverse Reactions section of the Swiss information for healthcare professionals.\nAEs (Q8W vs Q4W)\nSlightly fewer subjects from the Q8W than from the Q4W treatment group suffered non-serious AEs\nincluding injection site reactions in the ATLAS-2M study (91% vs 92%). However, this is more than\nwith oral SOC (see below) and is probably due to the less frequent injection site reactions (ISRs). An\nanalysis of AEs excluding ISRs was not provided.\nAEs (Q8W vs oral SOC)\nAcross the studies, the slightly lower AE frequency (including ISRs) under the Q8W versus the Q4W\ntreatment regimen is still much higher when compared with the oral SOC arms in the FLAIR and\nATLAS studies (91% vs 71-80%, see above).\nSwissPAR\nA post-hoc anchored indirect comparison of the Q8W treatment regimen with QD oral SOC, which\nused the Q4W treatment regimen as the common comparator, showed that \u2013 even when excluding\nISRs - the risk of AEs, grade 3-5 AEs and discontinuations due to AEs is higher for the Q8W\ntreatment regimen than for QD oral SOC ART regimens (odds ratios 1.2, 1.7 and 1.5, respectively).\nGreater use of pain killers was observed in patients on the long-acting injection treatment regimens\ncompared to oral SOC.\nThe adverse drug reactions of the Q4W and Q8W treatment regimens with CAB+RPV (including oral\nlead-in or bridging phases) are listed and described in the Warnings and Precautions section of the\nSwiss information for healthcare professionals.",

        "full-text": "Beneficial effects\nPK Vocabria (oral and IM):\nThe PK characteristics of cabotegravir are adequately characterised; the prolongation of the terminal\nhalf-life following IM administration is well understood. Therapeutically targeted cabotegravir plasma\nconcentrations are maintained during all phases of treatment following the Q4W or the Q8W dosing\nregimen.The PK of cabotegravir was assessed in patients with mild and moderate (Child Pugh A and\nB) hepatic impairment and in patients with mild, moderate and severe (not requiring dialysis) renal\nimpairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment or with severe renal impairment requiring\ndialysis were not investigated. The interaction potential was comprehensively assessed and results of\nthese assessments and respective dosing recommendations are included in the information for\nhealthcare professionals.There was no QT/QTc prolongation potential for cabotegravir at\nsupratherapeutic cabotegravir oral doses.\nQ4W treatment regimen\nEfficacy of the Q4W CAB+RPV treatment regimen was demonstrated in two pivotal Phase 3 studies,\nFLAIR and ATLAS, in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients who were\nvirologically suppressed for 5-6 months prior to start of treatment with CAB+RPV. Non-inferiority to\noral standard of care (DTG/ABC/3TC in the FLAIR study; a dual NRTI backbone plus INI, NNRTI or PI\nas a third drug in the ATLAS study) was shown with respect to loss of virologic suppression, the\nparameter of interest in switch trials.\nQ8W treatment regimen\nEfficacy of the Q8W CAB+RPV treatment regimen was demonstrated in the pivotal Phase 3b ATLAS-\n2M study in HIV-1-infected patients who were virologically suppressed prior to study start for at least 6\nmonths (either by Q4W CAB+RPV LAI or by oral SOC). Non-inferiority to the Q4W CAB+RPV\ntreatment regimen was shown with respect to loss of virologic suppression, the parameter of interest\nin switch trials.\nUncertainties about the beneficial effects\nAlthough Vocabria/Rekambys is a long-term treatment, no pivotal data on efficacy, development of\nHIV resistances and safety are available beyond 2 years.\nUnfavourable effects (risks)\nPK: The combined administration of cabotegravir with UGT1A1 inducers such as rifampicin is\ncontraindicated due to the 59% decrease in cabotegravir AUC and loss of antiviral activitiy.\nSwissPAR\nLong persisting drug release after IM injection (Q4W and Q8W)\nThe long persistence of the drug release is especially relevant after end of treatment with\nVocabria/Rekambys. There is neither a mechanism by which the drug release from the IM depots can\nbe stopped, nor a mechanism by which the IM depots can be removed or accessed by aspiration.\nFurthermore, once the drugs have reached the systemic circulation, there are no known neutralising\ndrugs or antibodies, and even if there were a short-term mechanism to reduce systemic\nconcentrations, these would be subsequently replaced by drug released from the IM depots. Lastly,\nboth CAB and RPV are heavily protein bound molecules and are not expected to be susceptible to\nremoval via hemodialysis. See also the Warnings and Precautions section of the Swiss information for\nhealthcare professionals.\nIn conclusion, the single death cases, the slightly higher risk of SAEs, the higher frequencies of non-\nserious AEs under the Q4W and Q8W treatment regimens with cabotegravir and rilpivirine in\ncomparison to the daily oral standard of care and any individual (S)AEs were not considered as\nprohibitive for approval.\nConclusion\n1. Q4W treatment regimen\nVocabria & Rekambys, a complete treatment regimen combining only the two antiretrovirals\ncabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV), is a new treatment option with a new route of administration\n(intramuscular long-acting injections, IM LAI) and a reduced dosing frequency (monthly, Q4W). In\nterms of efficacy, this treatment regimen has been proven to be non-inferior to standard oral\nantiretroviral regimens (SOC) in treatment-naive HIV-1-infected patients after a 5 month induction of\nvirologic suppression with SOC as well as in treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients who were\nvirologically suppressed for at least 6 months and had no history of virologic failure.\nIn terms of safety, the Q4W CAB+RPV IM LAI regimen appears to be associated with more\nrisks than oral SOC regimens because of a) the long persistence of drug release after IM injection, b)\na slightly higher frequency of SAEs (at least for treatment-naive patients in the first treatment year), c)\na distinctly higher frequency of grade 3-4 AEs and of AEs in general (with and without injection site\nreactions) and d) more frequent use of analgetics due to the very common ISRs.\nAll these above-mentioned uncertainties and risks can be regarded as acceptable as a) there\nwas no higher risk of fatal SAEs compared to oral SOC, b) the patients are free to switch back to oral\nSOC and c) all relevant information is provided in the Swiss information for healthcare professionals\nand patient information.\nIn summary, the benefit-risk ratio for the Q4W CAB+RPV IM LAI regimen is positive.\n2. Q8W treatment regimen\nVocabria & Rekambys, a complete treatment regimen combining only the two antiretrovirals\ncabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV), is a new treatment option with a new route of administration\n(intramuscular long-acting injections, IM LAI) and a reduced dosing frequency (monthly, Q4W).\nIn terms of efficacy, this treatment regimen has been proven non-inferior to the Q4W treatment\nregimen (with a very small numerical disadvantage) in HIV-1-infected patients who were virologically\nsuppressed for at least 6 months.\nThe Q8W treatment regimen was, however, not directly compared to standard oral\nantiretroviral regimens (SOC), which is considered acceptable based on the totality of the data. A\ncross-study comparison of the Q8W treatment regimen with oral SOC suggests a virologic failure rate\nSwissPAR\nin the same order of magnitude. A post-hoc indirect comparison with oral SOC, which used the Q4W\ntreatment regimen as the common comparator, revealed only slightly more treatment failures in the\nQ8W treatment regimen, which is acceptable because a switch back to one of numerous oral\nantiretroviral regimens is possible.\nIn terms of safety, the Q8W CAB+RPV IM LAI regimen appears to be associated with more\nrisks than oral SOC regimens because of a) the long persistence of drug release after IM injection,\nand b) a higher risk of SAEs, grade 3-5 AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation and AEs in general (with\nand without ISRs) \u2013 as suggested by a post-hoc indirect comparison between the Q8W treatment\nregimen and oral SOC.\nWhen comparing the Q8W with the Q4W treatment regimen, the Q8W regimen seems to be\nassociated with a slightly higher risk of SAEs and injection site reactions (ISRs). However, there was\nno difference in the frequency of grade 3 AEs, and a slightly lower frequency of grade 3 ISRs, slightly\nlower use of analgesics and a slightly lower frequency of non-serious AEs (including ISR). As the\nsafety differences between the two long-acting injection regimens were rather small (mostly 1% of\npatients), the two treatment regimens are considered interchangeable.\nIn summary, the benefit-risk ratio for the Q8W CAB+RPV IM LAI regimen is positive.",

In 2018, 770,000 people died of\nAcquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). There were approximately 1.7 million new HIV\ninfections around the world in 2018.\nIn Switzerland, around 17,000 people are living with HIV. In 2018, 425 new HIV diagnoses were made\nin Switzerland.\nTreatment\nGenerally, the initial antiretroviral treatment regimen for a treatment-naive patient consists of a three-\ndrug regimen containing\n\u2022 two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), also called an NRTI backbone,\nplus a third drug from one of the following three drug classes (anchor drug):\n\u2022 an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI),\n\u2022 a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI),\n\u2022 or a boosted protease inhibitor (PI).\nRecently, two-drug regimens for the treatment of people with HIV have also been approved:\n\u2022 DTG (dolutegravir) plus 3TC (lamivudine)\n\u2022 DTG (dolutegravir) plus RPV (rilpivirine)\nHowever, up to now there are no long-acting injections (LAIs) available for the treatment of HIV-1-\ninfection.\nVocabria/Rekambys is a novel 2-drug antiretroviral (ARV) regimen for HIV-1 infection. Vocabria, oral\nfilm-coated tablets contain the new active substance (NAS) cabotegravir sodium in one strength of 30\nmg. Vocabria, suspension for intramuscular (IM) injection, contains the NAS cabotegravir as a free\nacid in two different strengths: a 600 mg loading dose and a 400 mgmaintenance dose. Rekambys\nsuspension for IM injection contains the known active substance rilpivirine as a free base in this new\npharmaceutical formulation for this new route of administration.",
        "summary": "Vocabria has an antiretroviral action, i.e. it suppresses further replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Vocabria is a so-called integrase inhibitor, which blocks an enzyme (protein) called integrase. The virus requires integrase to enable it to manufacture new copies of itself. By blocking this enzyme Vocabria, combined with rilpivirine, lowers the viral load in the blood and keeps it at a low level. Vocabria cannot cure an HIV infection, but it can delay the onset of the resulting complications.",

Most serious adverse events (SAEs) in the pivotal studies also\noccurred with similar frequency (1.3% under active, 1.5% under placebo) compared to the placebo\ngroups and were based on other medical conditions. There were 2 patients with SAEs of suicidal\nattempts and 2 with suicidal ideation under active drug (total 3 SAEs of suicidality, since 1 SAE of\nideation and 1 attempt occurred in the same patient). These patients had a history of psychiatric\nconditions such as depression, anxiety or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). According to the\ntreatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) documentation, 11 cases (0.6%) of suicidal ideation\noccurred under active treatment, 3 (0.4%) under placebo. Most events were of mild severity, 1 of\nmoderate severity (including self-cutting). There were 14 reported TEAEs of hypersensitivity in the\nactive treatment arms, 13 of which led to study drug discontinuation, and no such events in the\nplacebo arms. One case was considered as possible anaphylaxis, but without relevant respiratory or\ncardiovascular effects.

        "full-text": "Migraine is a common neurological disorder that affects around 5% of the adult population (1-year\nprevalence: 8% in men, 20% in women) in western countries. It is characterised by episodic, often\ndisabling, headache, associated with sensory (aura) and autonomic symptoms (nausea, vomiting),\nphonophobia and photophobia, and cognitive symptoms. Episodic migraine (EM) is defined as <15\nheadache days per month, although in clinical prophylactic trials a lower threshold of a minimum of 4\nheadache days is often chosen to reflect typical patients in need of a prophylactic treatment. Chronic\nmigraine (CM) is defined as 15 or more headache days per month. At least 8 of these 15 or more\nheadache days have to be typical migraine days (for the exact definition see the International\nClassification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition).\nThere are established and approved substances for the acute treatment of migraine symptoms (such\nas triptans), and substances for the prevention of migraine attacks (such as beta blockers or\ntopiramate).\nGrowing evidence indicates that calcitonin gene-related peptides (CGRPs) play a key role in\nperipheral sensitisation and associated enhanced pain, and that these peptides could be involved in\nmigraine pathophysiology. Blocking the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or the CGRP receptor\nhas emerged as a possible mechanism for the prevention of migraine attacks. Amongst others,\ndecreasing blood flow in cerebral vessels and inhibition of pain transmission in the trigeminal ganglion\nare discussed as possible mechanisms for these antibodies.\nFor several antibodies targeting the CGRP-pathway, effects in preventing migraine have been shown\nin clinical trials and, since 2018, three of these antibodies (erenumab, galcanezumab, fremanezumab)\nhave been approved worldwide for the prophylaxis of episodic and chronic migraine. These\nsubstances show moderate efficacy comparable to established treatment options, combined with a\nrather benign safety profile. Eptinezumab is the fourth anti-CGRP antibody in this indication, but the\nfirst one with an intravenous (vs. subcutaneous) mode of administration.",
        "summary": "Migraines are a headache disorder with repeated, severe headaches and other symptoms that occur as sudden attacks. Women are far more frequently affected by this disorder than men. Depending on the frequency of attacks, migraines are classified as episodic (up to 14 days of headaches per month) or chronic (15 or more days of headaches per month). There are medications for acute treatment and for prevention (prophylaxis) of migraines.\nVyepti reduces the number of attacks or days of migraines and is therefore a preventive treatment. The exact mechanism of action is unknown. However, there is growing evidence that specific proteins known as calcitonin gene-related peptides (CGRPs) play an important role in migraine attacks. The active substance eptinezumab is a monoclonal antibody (immunologically active protein) and blocks the action of these CGRPs in the body.",

Apart from a slightly less than dose\nproportional increase of exposure due to its limited solubility, tafamidis PK is linear. No dose\nadjustments are required in mild or moderate hepatic impairment, renal impairment of all degrees or\nelderly patients.\nTafamidis is unlikely to inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 3A4 in vivo at therapeutic\nexposure. It had no effect on midazolam exposure in a clinical interaction study. Tafamidis is not a\nsubstrate of P-gp, MRP2, OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. In vivo inhibition of P-gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3,\nOCT2, MATE1 and MATE2K is unlikely.\nTafamidis had no effect on QTcF or heart rate at supratherapeutic exposure.\nClinical Pharmacology \u2013 Uncertainties related to the Beneficial Effects\nThe impact of proton-pump inhibitors or other antacids on the absorption of tafamidis is unknown, but\nthe risk of major interactions appears low.\nThe assessment of dose proportionality is largely based on oral solution data. The problem is\nattenuated by the fact that only one dose per formulation is applied for.\nThe metabolism of tafamidis has not been fully characterised. However, glucuronidation has been\nobserved and unchanged tafamidis is the main compound in plasma.\nThere are no data available on subjects with severe hepatic impairment. This point is appropriately\naddressed in the information for healthcare professionals.\nA dose of 20 mg tafamidis meglumine QD was used in the midazolam interaction study. Thus, the\neffect of tafamidis after 80/61 mg QD on midazolam is unknown. The tafamidis dose used in the\ninteraction study is indicated in the corresponding section of the information for healthcare\nprofessionals.\nNo data are available regarding the impact of other drugs (for example UGT inhibitors) on tafamidis\nPK. This point is appropriately addressed in the information for healthcare professionals.\nClinical Pharmacology \u2013 Unfavourable Effects\nTafamidis meglumine and tafamidis free acid are not bioequivalent on a mg basis, i.e. different doses\nare required to achieve comparable tafamidis exposure.\nThe possibility to inhibit BCRP, OAT1, OAT3 and intestinal UTG1A1 in vivo is appropriately\naddressed in the information for healthcare professionals.

        "full-text": "A single pivotal clinical study (COMET-ICE) was submitted in support of the marketing authorisation\napplication.\nSeveral further studies are currently ongoing with sotrovimab.\nCOMET-ICE was a Phase II/III randomised, multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to\nassess the safety and efficacy of sotrovimab for the early treatment of COVID-19 in non-hospitalised\npatients.\nThe study enrolled non-hospitalised participants with early, mild/moderate COVID-19 who were at risk\nof progression of disease in 57 centres (45 in the USA, 6 in Brazil, 3 in Spain, 2 in Canada, and 1 in\nPeru). The study consisted of a lead-in phase that served as the first-in-human assessment (20\nparticipants [planned 20, actual 21 as 1 subject withdrew on D5 and was replaced] 1:1 randomisation\nsotrovimab vs. placebo) followed by an expansion phase (1340 patients, 1:1 randomisation\nsotrovimab vs. placebo).\nThe study population included non-hospitalised \u2265 18 year-old patients who tested positive for SARS-\nCoV-2, oxygen saturation \u2265 94% on room air (i.e. no supplemental oxygen required), \u2264 5 days from\nonset of symptoms AND at high risk of progression of COVID-19 based on presence of one or more\nof the following risk factors:\nSwissPAR\n- diabetes (requiring medication)\n- obesity: BMI (>30-original protocol) >35 kg/m2 (Amendment 1)\n- chronic kidney disease (i.e., eGFR <60 by MDRD)\n- congestive heart failure (NYHA class II or more),\n- chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (history of chronic bronchitis, chronic\n- obstructive lung disease, or emphysema with dyspnoea on physical exertion)\n- moderate to severe asthma (participant requires an inhaled steroid to control symptoms or has\nbeen prescribed a course of oral steroids in the past year)\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants who have progression of COVID-19\nthrough Day 29 as defined by (i) hospitalisation > 24 hours for acute management of illness OR (ii)\ndeath. Other relevant secondary efficacy endpoints at the Day 29 analysis included time to symptom\nalleviation using a self-reporting symptom questionnaire (FLU-PRO Plus) questionnaire, 29-day 60-\nday and 90-day all-cause mortality and change from baseline in viral load in nasal secretions by\nquantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) at Day 8. Of note, the testing\nof secondary endpoints was adjusted for multiplicity by using a pre-defined hierarchy strategy.\nA total of 1351 participants were screened, and 1057 (ITT set) participants were randomly assigned to\nstudy treatment (sotrovimab: 528; placebo: 529). A total of 1049 participants were confirmed to have\nreceived the study treatment (sotrovimab: 523; placebo: 526). Participants in the sotrovimab arm\nreceived a single infusion of 500 mg sotrovimab. Of the 1049 participants, 1037 participants were\nfollowed for >29 days.\nDemographics and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the treatment arms. Median\nage was 53 years. 20% of the studied population were \u2265 65 years old and 11% \u2265 70 years old. The\nmain conditions considered as risk factors were obesity with a BMI >30 kg/m2 (ca. 65% of study\npopulation), age \u2265 55 years (ca. 50%) and diabetes (ca 20%).\nThe Day 29 analysis for the primary endpoint has been conducted on the ITT analysis set (N=1057).\n6/528 (1%) participants met progression criteria for the primary endpoint in the sotrovimab arm vs.\n30/529 (6%) in the Placebo arm. The adjusted risk reduction is 79%. Of note, according to the\napplicant, 3 of the 6 participants in the sotrovimab arm were hospitalised for events potentially\nunrelated to COVID-19, whereas all participants in the Placebo arm were hospitalised due to events\npotentially related to COVID-19. Results for the primary endpoint were consistent with those reported\nin the ITT population when, as a sensitivity analysis, participants with missing primary endpoint data\n(n=7 for sotrovimab, n=5 for placebo) were analysed as treatment failures, with a calculated adjusted\nrisk reduction of 62%. In subgroup analyses, as might be expected, the data generally show a higher\nproportion of progressions in the higher age group (participants >70 years) in both treatment arms,\nbut the sotrovimab arm maintained an advantage. In those \u2264 70 years, the proportions of participants\nwho have progression were <1% and 5% in the sotrovimab and placebo groups, respectively, and in\nthose \u2265 70 years, the proportions of participants who have progression were 4% and 13% in the\nsotrovimab and placebo groups, respectively.\nFor the all-cause mortality assessment by Day 29, 2 participants in the placebo arm had died of\nrespiratory complications (COVID-pneumonia and pneumonia), and no participants in the sotrovimab\narm had died at Day 29. Because of the small number of death events, statistical significance cannot\nbe determined. Nevertheless, the 2 death events at the Day 29 assessment occurred in the placebo\ngroup and were linked to respiratory complications (COVID-pneumonia and pneumonia). Of note,\nbecause of the data cut-off, not all participants could be evaluated for 60-day and 90-day mortality.\nClinical data linked to exploratory endpoints indicated that, compared to placebo, sotrovimab reduced\nthe number of participants who were admitted to hospital and, amongst those who required\nhospitalisation, resulted in a reduction in the duration of hospitalisation, reduced the incidence of an\nSwissPAR\nICU stay (no participants in the sotrovimab arm required an ICU stay), and no participants in the\nsotrovimab arm required mechanical ventilator support.\nThe study was performed at a time when the current variant causing the vast majority of infections in\nEurope (Delta) was not present. Therefore, the clinical efficacy of sotrovimab against this variant is\nnot established. However, in vitro data (pseudotyped virus-like particle neutralisation assays) indicate\nthat sotrovimab retains in vitro activity (i.e. < 5-fold change in IC50) against the variants of concern\nOmicron, Delta (Indian), Beta (South African), Gamma (Brazil), Alpha (UK) and against Epsilon,\nKappa and Iota.\nThe COMET-ICE Virology report (representing sequencing data for 38% of the total participants)\nstates that the amino acid variants were reported at consensus level (\u226515% allelic fraction). Variants\nat position E340 were the most frequently observed variants in the epitope. Variants at two positions,\nE340 and P337, resulted in significant EC50 shifts, indicating reduced susceptibility to sotrovimab.\nSequence and phenotypic analysis for all qualifying participants in COMET-ICE is ongoing, and the\nfinal version of the Virology report will need to be submitted when available (Clinical requirement).\nThe applicant is required to further monitor the in vitro activity of sotrovimab against VOCs, VOIs and\nto conduct pseudovirus and authentic virus assays.",
        "summary": "The efficacy of Xevudy was investigated in the COMET-ICE study with 1,057 patients. The patients were 18 years or older, were not hospitalised, had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and did not require supplemental oxygen. The onset of the COVID-19 symptoms was within the previous 5 days. The patients were at high risk of developing severe COVID-19. 528 people received a single infusion of sotrovimab and 529 people received a dummy drug (placebo). The hospitalisation and mortality rates were determined on day 29 post-infusion. These events (hospitalisation or death) occurred in 1% of the Xevudy group (6 out of 528 people), compared with 6% of the placebo group (30 out of 529 people). This corresponds to a 79% reduction in the risk of severe COVID-19 with Xevudy. The majority of patients in this study were infected with the original strain of SARS-CoV-2. Laboratory studies suggest that Xevudy is also effective against other virus variants such as Omicron (B.1.1.529/BA.1).",

        "full-text": "Vaccines are available and widely used for the prevention of COVID-19, and some therapeutics\nprovide a potential benefit in the later stages of the disease. The early administration of monoclonal\nantibodies is an attractive option to prevent a severe course of the disease, especially in patients with\nrisk factors. Currently, various monoclonal antibodies (used alone or in combination) have been\nengineered to that aim and might also be modified depending on the emergence of virus variants to\npreserve their efficacy.\nSotrovimab is a human SARS-COV-2 neutralising monoclonal antibody. It binds to a highly conserved\nepitope on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, outside of the receptor-\nbinding motif (RBM).\nFor single antibodies, there is a theoretical concern of promoting the emergence of treatment-\nresistant variants. This might be less likely with a combination product.\nA single pivotal study, COMET-ICE (VIR-7831-5001 GSK-214367), was submitted in support of this\nmarketing authorisation application.\nCOMET-ICE is an ongoing randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, placebo-controlled trial of\nsotrovimab for the early treatment of COVID-19 in non-hospitalised participants. The data submitted\nare based on the planned day 29 analysis with all randomised participants (N=1057).\nBeneficial Effects\nSotrovimab has the typical PK profile of an IgG monoclonal antibody with an extended half-life. The\nsotrovimab PK was in the linear range after the administered single dose of 500 mg. Apart from\nweight, none of the covariates investigated (including age, gender, hepatic and renal function) had a\nclinically relevant impact on sotrovimab PK. The simulated sotrovimab tissue concentrations\nexceeded the tissue-adjusted IC90 for 196 days post-dose and the10-fold IC90 for at least 56 days\npost-dose.\nWhen used in high-risk patients, sotrovimab treatment was associated with a significant reduction in\nhospitalisation for the main COVID-19-related morbidities, that is progression of infection in the\nrespiratory tract leading to severe pneumonia and the need for supplemental oxygen and\nhospitalisation.\nIn the COMET-ICE study, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants who have\nprogression of COVID-19 through Day 29 as defined by (i) hospitalisation > 24 hours for acute\nmanagement of illness OR (ii) death. In the ITT analysis (N=1057, 528 patients in the sotrovimab arm\nand 529 patients in the placebo arm) 1% in the sotrovimab treatment group showed progression of\nCOVID-19 vs. 6% in the placebo group, corresponding to a 79% risk reduction. Other relevant\nsecondary efficacy endpoints at the day 29 analysis (time to symptom alleviation using a self-\nreporting symptom questionnaire, change from baseline in viral load, all-cause mortality) were also in\nfavour of the sotrovimab treatment.\nBased on in-vitro data, sotrovimab retains activity against the Delta and Omicron variants.\nSwissPAR\nUncertainties regarding the Beneficial Effects\nThe popPK dataset included only a small number of patients with moderate or severe hepatic or\nsevere renal impairment. Potential pharmacokinetic differences between Gen 1 and Gen 2 material\nare currently under investigation. Therefore, the available PK data of the COMET-ICE study should be\nregarded as preliminary.\nNo formal clinical assessment was conducted to exclude the possibility that the differences between\nGen 1 (used in the pivotal study) and Gen 2 (to-be-marketed) sotrovimab do not have an effect on\nefficacy. Data from clinical studies using the Gen 2 material (as study COMET-PEAK) will be able to\nprovide further information.\nClinical efficacy or PK data for adolescents were not available.\nBased on in vitro pseudotyped virus-like particle neutralisation assays, sotrovimab retains activity\nagainst the variants of concern: Omicron, Delta (and Delta Plus AY.1 and AY.2), Beta, Gamma,\nAlpha, and against Epsilon, Kappa and Iota. Based on an authentic virus assay, sotrovimab is active\nagainst Beta, Gamma and Delta variants, but no data are yet available for the Delta plus and Omicron\nvariants.\nFurthermore, no clinical data are available regarding efficacy against the Delta variant, as none of the\nsubjects included in the study had a Delta variant infection. The rate of subjects infected with the\nAlpha variant was also low (4%).\nNor are there any clinical efficacy data against the Omicron variant that rapidly became the\npredominant variant in Switzerland by the end of December 2021. However, based on the currently\navailable in-vitro (pseudovirus assay) data, Xevudy is expected to be active against the newly\nemerged Omicron variant.\nThe applicant will monitor the presence and emergence of VOCs/VOIs and assess the in vitro activity\nof sotrovimab using a pseudotyped virus system and, when possible, authentic virus. The applicant\nwill also sequence participant samples in ongoing sotrovimab clinical trials and assess sotrovimab\nefficacy in a clinical setting.\nUnfavourable Effects\nThe available PK data were obtained after administration of Gen 1 drug material only. Potential\npharmacokinetic differences between Gen 1 and Gen 2 material are currently under investigation.\nThe safety findings from the pivotal COMET-ICE study were supplemented by safety data from\nstudies in which sotrovimab was utilised in different populations and/or in combination with other\nmonoclonal antibodies.\nIn the review of the totality of the safety data, hypersensitivity reactions were deemed as an identified\nrisk (adverse drug reaction). Although anaphylaxis was not reported in COMET-ICE, there was one\nreport of a severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction in a hospitalised patient with COVID-19 in the\nACTIV-3-TICO study meeting the criteria for an anaphylactic reaction. Furthermore, one case of\ncytokine release syndrome related to sotrovimab was also observed in the ACTIV-3 TICO study.\nUncertainties regarding the Unfavourable Effects\nNo safety data are available for adolescents over 12 years of age.\nNo formal clinical assessment was conducted to exclude the possibility that the differences between\nGen 1 (used in the pivotal study) and Gen 2 (to-be-marketed) sotrovimab have an effect on safety.\nHigher exposure at day 29 for Gen 2 was observed, although the pharmacovigilance on the\nemergency use and marketed use of the Gen 2 material did not identify new safety findings. The\nsafety results from ongoing studies using the Gen 2 material needs to be submitted when available\n(Clinical Requirement).\nSwissPAR\nBenefit \u2013Risk Assessment Clinic\nThe overall benefit-risk of sotrovimab for the treatment of mild/moderate COVID-19 to prevent\nprogression to severe COVID-19, the need for oxygen therapy, hospitalisation or death in SARS-CoV-\n2 infected high-risk patients is positive.\nThe available sotrovimab PK data did not raise any concerns. However, due to the still ongoing\nevaluation of possible differences between Gen 1 and Gen 2 material, they should be regarded as\npreliminary.\nEfficacy against the currently most prevalent Omicron variant is clinically not established. However,\nbased on in-vitro pseudotyped virus-like particle neutralisation assays, sotrovimab retains activity -\namong others - against the previously predominant Delta variant and also against the currently\npredominant Omicron variant.\nThe clinical efficacy of sotrovimab against emerging new VOCs remains to be determined and must\nbe actively monitored.",
        "summary": "The COMET-ICE study found that Xevudy can reduce the risk of hospitalisation or death in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who are at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19. COMET-ICE was not conducted in patients who were infected with newer virus variants such as Omicron. The clinical efficacy of Xevudy as regards the new virus variants must therefore be actively monitored.\nThe safety profile of Xevudy is considered to be positive.\nFor these reasons, Xevudy, containing the active substance sotrovimab, has been temporarily authorised in Switzerland (Art. 9a TPA). The temporary authorisation is contingent on the timely submission of the data requested by Swissmedic. Once these authorisation conditions have been met, the temporary authorisation can be converted into an ordinary authorisation in the event of a positive benefit-risk assessment of the results.",

Of these 522 patients, 319 received a starting\ndose of gilteritinib 120 mg (including all 246 patients from study 2215-CL-0301).\nThe most frequent TEAEs (treatment-emergent adverse events) were ALT and AST elevations,\nanaemia, thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, diarrhoea, nausea, blood alkaline phosphatase\nincreased, fatigue, creatine phosphokinase elevation, constipation, neutropenia, dysgeusia, pyrexia,\nQT-prolongation, headache, vomiting, decreased appetite, myalgia, peripheral oedema, and rash.\nSwissPAR\nOverall, 96% of patients presented \u2265 grade 3 toxicity, including 55% of patients with drug-related\nTEAEs. The most frequent were anaemia, thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, ALT or AST\nelevation, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, fatigue, diarrhoea, and ECG QT prolonged\n(1.1%).\nDeaths\nOverall, 181 fatal TEAEs were observed in all 522 gilteritinib treated patients. Of these deaths, 18\nwere considered to be drug-related. Drug-related TEAEs leading to death were as follows: septic\nshock (3 patients), sepsis (1), pneumonia (3), respiratory failure (2), cerebral haemorrhage (1), large\nintestinal perforation (2), congestive heart failure (1), cellulitis (1), intracranial haemorrhage (1),\nintestinal ischaemia (1), neutropenia (1), pulmonary embolism (1), ventricular fibrillation (1),\ndepressed level of consciousness (1), haemoptysis (1), and subdural haematoma (1).\nSerious Adverse Events (SAEs)\nSAEs were observed in 33% of patients treated with gilteritinib and comprised febrile neutropenia,\npyrexia and pneumonia, but also transaminases increased, respiratory failure, syncope, and\nhypotension, all considered drug-related by the investigators.\nTEAEs leading to withdrawal of treatment\nTreatment withdrawal due to TEAEs was observed in 10% of patients, and the most frequent reasons\nwere increased transaminases and pneumonia. Approximately 43% of patients had treatment\ninterruptions due to adverse events (AEs) and 20% had dose-reductions.\nAEs of special interest were defined by the applicant and comprised PRES (posterior reversible\nencephalopathy syndrome), cardiac failure, pericarditis, QT prolongation, creatine phosphokinase\nelevation and myopathy, liver transaminases elevation, differentiation syndrome, gastrointestinal\nobstruction, perforation and bleeding, pancreatitis, and drug hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis. All of these\nAEs were described in at least one patient and are considered safety risks. Most of these are rare\nevents except for the transaminase increase that was observed in more than one third of patients, as\nwell as creatine phosphokinase increase and QT prolongation that were also observed with\nfrequencies of 10% and 7%, respectively.\nConclusion safety: Gilteritinib increased liver transaminases and caused hematologic toxicity, which is\nconfounded by the underlying disease and previous treatments. The same is true for the high\nincidence of infectious complications under gilteritinib. Another safety issue is cardiac safety with\nseveral cardiac deaths in the gilteritinib-treated patients versus none in the chemotherapy control\ngroup and the documented QT prolongation under gilteritinib.

        "full-text": "The application is based on one pivotal study 2215-CL-0301, the ADMIRAL trial. This trial included\nadult patients with FLT3-mutated AML that had relapsed after one prior line of treatment or that was\nrefractory to first line treatment. Patients with secondary AML (treatment-induced; very poor\nprognosis) or with promyelocytic leukaemia (excellent outcome with treatment by retinoic acid and\narsenic) were not eligible.\nADMIRAL was a phase 3 superiority trial comparing the efficacy of gilteritinib with standard salvage\nchemotherapy in relapsed/refractory AML patients presenting FLT3 mutations (FLT3-ITD, FLT3-\nTKD/D835 or FLT3-TKD/I836). Patients had to be eligible for rescue chemotherapy of the\ninvestigator\u2019s choice, have normal renal and liver function, no GVHD (graft-versus-host disease) and\nan ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of 0-2. The chemotherapy\ncontrol arm was an investigator\u2019s choice between 4 different regimens (two low-dose [low-dose\ncytarabine and azacitidine] and two high-dose [MEC and [FLAG-IDA] regimens). No formal criteria\nwere described on how patients were pre-selected for high-dose versus low-dose salvage therapy.\nPatients were stratified based on their response to first-line treatment and according to salvage\nchemotherapy (low-dose or high-dose) pre-determined by the investigator before randomisation. Sixty\npercent (60%) of patients were pre-determined for high-dose and 40% for low-dose chemotherapy\nSwissPAR\n(without specification of the exact regimen), and this was well balanced between the two treatment\narms, as could be expected given the stratification for this variable.\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. While the study was already recruiting, a co-\nprimary endpoint of CR/CRh rate was added for the gilteritinib arm. At the same time an interim\nanalysis was added when approximately 141 patients were randomised to the gilteritinib arm and\nwere at least 112 days (4 treatment cycles) past the first dose of gilteritinib or randomisation (for\npatients who did not receive gilteritinib). This co-primary endpoint was only to be analysed during this\nnew interim analysis and showed a CR/CRh rate that allowed for continuation of the study (lower\nbound of the 95% CI above 12% which corresponds to previously described response rates with\nchemotherapy in this indication). Alpha spending was correctly performed for the statistical analysis\nplan. Key secondary endpoints were event-free survival (EFS) and CR rate, as well as safety.\nGilteritinib was administered orally without food once a day continuously at 120 mg (3 tablets of 40\nmg). Chemotherapy regimens were administered according to published standards. High-dose\nchemotherapy was assessed with bone marrow (BM) aspiration after one cycle (approximately day\n15), and the treatment decision was based on response and BM cellularity. Low-dose chemotherapy\nand gilteritinib were continued until toxicity, progression, lack of efficacy (no response) or no more\nclinical benefit according to the investigator. Gilteritinib could be dose-reduced to 80 mg and then 40\nmg. If 40 mg once daily was not tolerated, then no further dose-reduction was allowed, and treatment\nhad to be discontinued. Dose-interruptions were allowed for a maximum of 14 days, after which\ntreatment had to be definitively discontinued. No re-escalation was allowed.\nFor gilteritinib, azacitidine and LoDAC (low-dose cytarabine), treatment was continued until\nprogression, intolerable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. For the higher dose chemotherapy\nregimens, treatment could also be interrupted due to lack of efficacy after one cycle, or if patients\nwent on to HSCT. After treatment discontinuation, patients had an end of treatment visit within 7 days\nafter treatment discontinuation, followed by a 30-day follow-up. After that, patients entered the long-\nterm follow-up every 3 months for overall survival only.\nThe study planned to randomise 369 patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive gilteritinib or salvage\nchemotherapy. For the final analysis, the planned 258 death events provide about 90% power to\ndetect a difference in OS between the gilteritinib arm with 7.7 months median survival time and\nsalvage chemotherapy arm with 5 months median survival time (HR = 0.65) at the overall 1-sided\n0.0245 significance level.\nA total of 371 patients were randomised, 247 to the gilteritinib arm and 124 to salvage chemotherapy.\nIn the salvage chemotherapy, fewer patients received treatment (87.9%) compared to the gilteritinib\narm (99.6%). At the 30-day follow-up, there was a higher rate of patient withdrawals in the\nchemotherapy control arm (19 [15.3%]) versus 5 (2.0%) in the gilteritinib arm). In the long-term safety\nfollow-up there were more patient withdrawals in the chemotherapy arm, with 18.5% compared to the\ngilteritinib arm with 2.8%. This withdrawal to follow-up has an even greater impact since follow-up\ntime was short in the salvage chemotherapy arm that foresaw only one visit at 30 days after\ncompletion of treatment and then only a survival status check via telephone contact every 3 months.\nGiven that the majority of patients were preselected for high-dose chemotherapy, which was\nadministered for a maximum of two cycles, follow-up time was, at most, 3 months, and this in a\npopulation of patients with an expected median OS of 5 months (according to the statistical analysis\nplan). There were only 56.5% of patients in the salvage chemotherapy arm versus 87.9% in the\ngilteritinib arm who fell into the per protocol analysis set.\nOverall, there were slightly more than 10% of patients with protocol deviations. These were balanced\nbetween the arms and should not therefore influence the interpretation of the study results. The\nbaseline characteristics were well balanced. Most patients fall into the intermediate cytogenetic risk\ngroup (73%), but approximately 10% had unfavourable cytogenetics. About 16% of patients were not\nSwissPAR\nclassifiable into favourable, intermediate, or unfavourable risk. Approximately 40% of patients were \u2265\n65 years old and > 80% had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. There were no significant\ndifferences between the two arms regarding prior therapy and response to prior therapy, duration of\nresponse, and time since diagnosis. No information was provided on therapies received after study\nparticipation.\nTreatment exposure was shorter in the chemotherapy arm, particularly since a majority of patients\nreceived high-dose chemotherapy that was pre-defined for one or two cycles only. Median duration of\nexposure to gilteritinib was 126 days.\nOS was significantly longer in the gilteritinib arm in the ITT population, with a median OS of 9.3\n(95% CI: 7.7, 10.7) months compared to the salvage chemotherapy arm with a median of 5.6 (95%\nCI: 4.7, 7.3) months using a Kaplan-Meier estimate (HR: 0.637; 95% CI: 0.490, 0.830; 1-sided P-\nvalue 0.0004). The survival probability was higher in the gilteritinib arm compared to the salvage\nchemotherapy arm at 6 months (65.5% versus 48.9%) and 12 months (37.1% versus 16.7%).\nRegarding secondary endpoints, the study did not show a significant improvement in EFS (event-free\nsurvival). The other key secondary endpoint was CR/CRh rate, which was to be tested hierarchically\nafter EFS. Given that EFS was not statistically significant, the CR/CRh rate is only exploratory, but\nshows a trend towards higher response rates in the gilteritinib arm compared to the chemotherapy\narm. Median time to response in the gilteritinib arm was 3.7 months.\nPatients who were eligible per the institutional guidelines and had a suitable donor were allowed to\nproceed to HSCT. While patients in the chemotherapy arm went off study at HSCT and were only\nfollowed for OS, patients in the gilteritinib arm were allowed to continue on study and could resume\ngilteritinib after successful HSCT. More patients in the gilteritinib group went on to receive HSCT\n(25.5% versus 15.3% in the gilteritinib and salvage chemotherapy arms, respectively).\nEfficacy conclusion: Gilteritinib increased median OS in the ITT population compared to salvage\nchemotherapy from 5.6 months to 9.3 months with an HR of 0.637; 95% CI: 0.490, 0.830 and a 1-\nsided P-value of 0.0004. The survival probability was higher in the gilteritinib arm compared to the\nsalvage chemotherapy arm at 6 months (65.5% versus 48.9%) and 12 months (37.1% versus 16.7%)\nwhen at 12 months 25% of the gilteritinib population and 10% of the chemotherapy population\nremained at risk. The secondary endpoint of improved EFS was not reached. CR/CRh rates were\nbetter in the gilteritinib arm, at 34.0% [84/247]) compared to the salvage chemotherapy arm (15.3%\n[19/124]). Transfusion-dependency was another secondary endpoint. Among the 197 patients in the\ngilteritinib arm who were dependent on RBC and/or platelet transfusions at baseline, 68 (34.5%)\nbecame independent of RBC and platelet transfusions during any 56-day postbaseline period. For the\n49 patients who were independent of both RBC and platelet transfusions at baseline, 29 (59.2%)\nremained transfusion-independent during any 56-day postbaseline period.",

        "full-text": "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a biologically heterogeneous disease that is rapidly fatal if left\nuntreated. Incidence of AML increases with age. The WHO classification of AML is based on\nmicroscopic, cytogenetic, and molecular characteristics. Therapy is individually tailored to each\npatient according to the biology of the disease and the age and comorbidities of the patient. For fit\npatients, the therapeutic intent is curative. FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication\n(FLT3-ITD) mutations have been associated with increased risk of relapse, while the prognostic\nrelevance of FLT3-tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations is controversial.\nThe majority of patients, who relapse after initial complete response (CR), will relapse within 3 years\nafter diagnosis. There is no standard treatment regimen defined for relapsed and/or refractory (R/R)\nAML. No clinical trial has shown superiority of any particular treatment combination. Salvage therapy\naims at achieving a second CR in order to propose HSCT for fit candidates. The likelihood of\nachieving a second CR is best in patients with a long first remission, younger age, and in those with\nSwissPAR\nfavourable cytogenetics. For patients who are not candidates for a new high-dose induction therapy,\nhypomethylating agents are an alternative. Response rates for salvage chemotherapies lie between\n32-79%, and median OS remains poor at 3-12 months.\nThere is a high unmet medical need.\nGilteritinib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase.\nFLT3 is often mutated in AML and confers a poor prognosis. Gilteritinib is an oral medication, taken\nonce a day without food in a continuous manner. In the phase 3 ADMIRAL trial, it was shown to\nimprove overall survival in relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML patients who had received one\nprior line of therapy compared to the investigator's choice chemotherapy from 5.6 months to 9.3\nmonths with an HR of 0.637 (95% CI: 0.490- to 0.830, p=0.0004 one-sided log rank test). Overall,\nresponse rate was a key secondary endpoint and was in favour of gilteritinib compared to\nchemotherapy with 21.1% vs 10.5%, respectively, obtaining a CR. However, due to the hierarchical\ntesting strategy to preserve the alpha-level, this difference cannot be considered statistically\nsignificant since event-free survival, which was ahead in the hierarchy, was not significant.\nNevertheless, the difference is clinically important.\nMedian duration of CR in the gilteritinib arm was 14.8 months, and the overall OS analysis in the ITT\npopulation showed a survival benefit of nearly 4 months in favour of gilteritinib. The stress test\nperformed to weigh the early censoring of patients in the chemotherapy arm was consistent with the\nprimary analysis. In addition, in the gilteritinib arm 34% of transfusion dependent patients became\ntransfusion independent, and 60% of transfusion independent patients remained so on gilteritinib.\nGilteritinib increases liver transaminases and creatine phosphokinase. One patient in the overall\nsafety population experienced rhabdomyolysis. Gilteritinib induces a QT-prolongation. Gilteritinib has\nhaematological toxicity with higher rates of cytopenia, particularly compared to low-dose\nchemotherapy. There were treatment-related deaths in the gilteritinib treatment arm, mostly due to\ninfections but also to cardiac events including ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. Cases\nof posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) were observed under gilteritinib. There were\nevents of pancreatitis under gilteritinib. Differentiation syndrome was also described as an adverse\nevent of gilteritinib.\nTo compare toxicity of gilteritinib to chemotherapy was challenging given the 2:1 randomisation with\nfewer patients in the chemotherapy arm and the heterogeneous treatments with four different\nregimens in the control arm. Separate analyses for toxicity of patients treated with gilteritinib\ncompared to patients treated with low-dose chemotherapy exclusively in patients pre-selected for low-\ndose chemotherapy, showed higher incidences of TEAEs, grade 3/4 AEs and SAEs in patients\ntreated with gilteritinib. When comparing patients pre-selected for high-dose chemotherapy and\ntreated with gilteritinib with patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy, toxicity was similar. The\ndifference is that high-dose chemotherapy was administered over a much shorter time period. Overall,\ncomparative safety data are limited and safety data rely mostly on non-comparative observations.\nTherefore, in view of the OS benefit, the higher ORR with a long duration of response and\nmanageable toxicity the benefit-risk profile is evaluated as positive.",
        "summary": "Acute myeloid leukaemia is a form of blood cancer that is quickly fatal if left untreated.\nThe studies showed that patients treated with Xospata survived longer.\nComparing the side effects between gilteritinib and chemotherapy was challenging because fewer participants received chemotherapy and four different chemotherapy regimens were administered (two high-dose and two low-dose regimens).\nPatients treated with gilteritinib reported more side effects than those treated with low-dose chemotherapy. Side effects were similar when comparing gilteritinib with high-dose chemotherapy.\nTaking into account all the available data, the benefits of Xospata outweigh the risks. Swissmedic has therefore authorised the medicine Xospata with the active ingredient gilteritinib for use in Switzerland.",

Other proteins can bind to it, acting like an \u201con\u201d switch telling the cell to grow and make more copies of itself.\nAcute myeloid leukaemia is a type of blood cancer that originates in the bone marrow. It is rapidly fatal if left untreated. This particular genetic mutation, found in 25 to 30 % of patients, has been linked to a higher risk of relapse.",

        "full-text": "6.4 Safety\nA total of 3,441 subjects were exposed to ozanimod in the clinical studies (2,787 subjects with RMS,\n654 subjects with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease), including 3,276 subjects treated with\nozanimod 0.92 mg and 1,098 subjects treated with ozanimod 0.46 mg.\nApproximately 92% of patients in both pivotal studies (SUNBEAM, RADIANCE) were exposed to\nozanimod or IFN \u03b2-1a for at least 12 months, and approximately 34% of subjects were exposed to\nozanimod or IFN \u03b2-1a for at least 24 months.\nTotal cumulative exposures to ozanimod 0.92 mg and 0.46 mg were 1,323.3 and 1,318.0 patient-\nyears, respectively.\nThe adverse reactions presented in the information for healthcare professionals are based on safety\ninformation from 882 patients treated with ozanimod 0.92 mg and 885 treated with IFN beta-1a.\nThe most common adverse reactions were nasopharyngitis (11%), increased levels of alanine\naminotransferase (5%) and increased levels of gamma-glutamyltransferase (5%).\nThe incidences of severe adverse events (AEs) were low and similar across the ozanimod 0.92 mg,\nozanimod 0.46 mg, and IFN \u03b2-1a treatment groups (2.5%, 3.3%, and 3.3%, respectively). The\nincidence of moderate AEs was lower in the ozanimod treatment groups compared with the IFN \u03b2-1a\ntreatment group, largely due to the higher incidence of moderate influenza-like illness in the IFN \u03b2-1a\ngroup.\nThere were six subject deaths over the entire ozanimod clinical development programme as of 30 Jun\n2018. All subjects had exposure to study drug with ozanimod. Even though all cases were considered\nto be unrelated to study drug by the investigator/sponsor, one case of posterior reversible\nencephalopathy syndrome (PRES) during treatment with ozanimod 0.92mg resulted in chronic kidney\nfailure after discontinuation of the study drug, which might be considered to be a consequence of the\ntreatment with ozanimod. A secondary connection due to autonomic dysfunction and/or therapy with\nimmunoglobulins with a previously occurring Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) (Basavaraj et al., 2014)\nunder treatment with ozanimod cannot be excluded in this case.\nA warning in the product information concerning PRES was implemented.\nBased on the known biology of S1P modulators, special attention was paid to the assessment of\ncardiac effects, hepatic effects, infections, consequences of lymphopenia, macular oedema,\nmalignancies, and pulmonary effects. Depression and suicidality were also identified for detailed\nanalysis because of their association with the underlying disease state.\nCardiac effects\nIn the phase 3 studies of approximately 1,774 subjects treated with ozanimod, initiation of the dose\nescalation regimen resulted in modest and not clinically meaningful reductions in heart rate (HR) on\nDay 1 (mean HR reduction from baseline of 1.2 bpm with a nadir at Hour 5, with return towards\nbaseline by Hour 6). There were no reports of HR < 40 bpm. There were no occurrences of second-\nor third-degree AV block. It should be noted that patients with clinically significant cardiovascular\nhistory were excluded from these studies, as were patients taking medications that reduce HR or\naffect cardiac conduction.\nWith the help of the selected dose escalation regimen, the cardiac safety profile is improved to a\ncertain extent. However, the risk of bradyarrhythmia is still maintained in all patients, not only in\npatients with certain pre-existing cardiac conditions. The need for additional monitoring, at least\nduring treatment initiation, was questioned and according contraindications and warnings\nimplemented in the labelling. Before initiation of treatment with ozanimod, an ECG should be\nperformed in all patients to determine whether any pre-existing cardiac conditions are present.\nA 6-hour monitoring for signs and symptoms of symptomatic bradycardia is recommended after\nadministration of the first dose in the case of patients with a resting HR <55 bpm, second-degree\n[Mobitz type I] AV block or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure.\nSwissPAR\nDuring chronic treatment in the phase 3 studies, subjects treated with ozanimod 0.92 mg for up to 24\nmonths showed an increase in supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) versus IFN \u03b2-1a of 1.6 mm Hg\nand a 0.9 mm Hg increase versus IFN \u03b2-1a in supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP).\nHypertension as an AE was reported in a greater proportion of subjects in the ozanimod treatment\ngroups compared with IFN \u03b2-1a (3.4%, 3.5%, and 2.0% in the ozanimod 0.92 mg, ozanimod 0.46 mg,\nand IFN \u03b2-1a treatment groups, respectively).\nThe incidence of AEs in the cardiac disorders and vascular disorders system organ classes (SOCs)\ndid not increase with longer term exposure with ozanimod 0.92 mg.\nHepatic effects\nConsistent with what has been observed with other S1P receptor modulators, hepatic enzyme\nelevations, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma-\nglutamyltransferase (GGT), were seen with ozanimod treatment.\nPre-existing liver disease or male gender may be risk factors for the development of elevated hepatic\nenzymes when taking ozanimod. Therefore, ozanimod should be used with caution in these patients\nand is contraindicated in patients with severe pre-existing liver damage (Child-Pugh Class C).\nIn the pivotal trials, elevations of ALT to 5-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) or above has occurred\nin 1.6% of patients treated with 0.92 mg of ozanimod and 1.3% of patients treated with IFN beta-1a.\nElevations of 3-fold the ULN or above has occurred in 5.5% of patients on ozanimod and 3.1% of\npatients on IFN beta-1a. The median time to elevation of 3-fold the ULN was 6 months. The majority\n(79%) continued the treatment with ozanimod, with the values returning to < 3-fold the ULN within\napproximately 2 to 4 weeks.\nIn clinical trials, ozanimod has been discontinued for a confirmed elevation greater than 5-fold the\nULN. Overall, the discontinuation rate due to elevations in hepatic enzymes has been 1.1% of\npatients on 0.92 mg of Zeposia and 0.8% of patients on IFN beta-1a.\nNo case of Hy's law was documented.\nSmall increases in mean total bilirubin, primarily unconjugated bilirubin, occurred with ozanimod\nrelative to IFN \u03b2-1a. Subjects with underlying total bilirubin elevation, including those with Gilbert\u2019s\nsyndrome, may be at increased risk of developing elevated bilirubin when taking ozanimod.\nElevations that occurred in hepatic tests occurred were generally asymptomatic and resolved with\ncontinued treatment and were not observed to lead to severe drug-induced liver injury.\nInfections\nOzanimod causes a mean reduction in the peripheral blood lymphocyte count to 45% of baseline\nvalues because of the reversible retention of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues. Ozanimod may,\ntherefore, increase the susceptibility to infections.\nIn the phase 3 RMS studies, the incidence of infections was similar between the ozanimod (0.92 mg\nand 0.46 mg) and IFN \u03b2-1a treatment groups (35.1%, 33.9%, 34.5%, respectively). Adverse events of\ninfections leading to discontinuation of study drug were low (0.1% in all 3 treatment groups).\nOzanimod treatment in the OLE for up to 68 months demonstrated that the rate of overall infections,\nserious infections, and opportunistic infections did not increase over time.\nThe most frequently reported infections with ozanimod that occurred at \u2265 1% higher incidence than\nwith IFN \u03b2-1a were non-serious infections of the upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis,\nviral respiratory tract infection) and urinary tract infection. The incidence of serious infections was low\nand similar across treatment groups.\nThere were no disseminated or serious opportunistic infections reported with ozanimod treatment.\nThe majority of serious infections were typical bacterial infections and resolved without clinical\nsequelae following standard medical management. Herpes zoster, an opportunistic infection of\nspecial interest, was infrequent in ozanimod groups but tended to increase in frequency with time.\nNo serious infections were reported in subjects with an ALC < 0.2 x 109\n.\nNo case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been reported so far.\nSwissPAR\nMacular oedema (MO)\nIn the ozanimod RMS programme, optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used as a standard\nscreening tool to identify subjects for further ophthalmologic examination. No trend in macular\nthickness changes were noted over time with repeat OCTs with mild increases balanced across\ngroups.\nA total of 7/2,787 subjects (0.3%) in the RMS clinical programme with ozanimod treatment had\nconfirmed MO. Two confirmed cases were identified in the IBD programme. Overall, there were\n9/3,441 (0.3%) confirmed cases of MO reported in the entire ozanimod programme. All cases of\nconfirmed MO were identified with OCT findings consistent with MO, and all cases were associated\nwith pre-existing risk factors or comorbid conditions that are known to cause MO. Eight of the 9\nsubjects recovered following discontinuation of study drug; the remaining case (secondary to ocular\ntrauma) was reported to be stable as of the last available follow-up. No confirmed cases were seen in\nthe IFN \u03b2-1a treatment group.\nMalignancies\nMalignancies were examined due to the potential effects of ozanimod as an immunomodulatory\nagent. In the pivotal trials, the incidence of AEs in the SOC of Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and\nUnspecified (including Cysts and Polyps) was similar across treatment groups (21 [2.4%] subjects,\nozanimod 0.92 mg; 19 [2.1%] subjects, ozanimod 0.46 mg; 24 [2.7%] subjects, IFN \u03b2-1a).\nSubjects with a history of malignancies (other than treated basal cell carcinoma) were excluded from\nthe phase 3 RMS studies.\nOf the 10 total malignancies in the ozanimod groups (including 2 that were retrospectively determined\nto be pre-existing), 5 were cutaneous and 5 were non-cutaneous.\nThe most frequently reported cutaneous malignancy with ozanimod was basal cell carcinoma (n = 3)\nand the most frequently reported non-cutaneous malignancies, consistent with the mostly female\nRMS population, were breast cancers (n = 3). There were 2 malignancies in the IFN \u03b2-1a treatment\ngroup, a basal cell carcinoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.\nPulmonary Effects\nPulmonary function is known to be affected by other S1P receptor modulators, and patients with MS\nmay be at increased risk of respiratory problems.\nPulmonary safety for ozanimod was examined in the clinical development programme using\nspirometry, diffusing capacity (DLCO) and AEs related to pulmonary function designated as adverse\nevents of special interest (AESIs) in Phase 2 and Phase 3 RMS studies.\nSmall decreases in these spirometry assessments were observed in the ozanimod 0.92 mg treatment\ngroup relative to the 0.46 mg or IFN \u03b2-1a treatment groups with up to 24 months of treatment. These\nchanges were not clinically meaningful and were primarily driven by changes during the first\n3 months. These early small changes for the 0.92 mg ozanimod dose were not progressive through\n12 months.\nOf 8 subjects with concurrent decreases in forced vital capacity (FVC) and DLCO (5 of these came\nfrom one investigator site), the baseline % predicted FVC was greater than 100 in 7 out of 8 with the 2\nhighest likely representing erroneous and/or unphysiological values.\nCollectively, the declines in FVC in these subjects may represent regression to the mean or learning\neffect rather than a clinically significant reduction in lung function.\nAbsolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC)\nDecreases in ALC are an expected treatment effect of ozanimod and were observed as early as\n1 month after the start of therapy. For subjects in the ozanimod 0.92 mg and ozanimod 0.46 mg\ngroups, sustained reduction was seen throughout the treatment period.\nThe decrease in ALC was dose-dependent. The number of subjects with an ALC < 0.2 x 109/L was\nhigher in the 0.92 mg ozanimod group (n = 29, 3.3%) than in the ozanimod 0.46 mg group (n = 4,\nSwissPAR\n0.4%) and the IFN \u03b2-1a (n = 0). The majority of these subjects (22/29 [75.9%] in the ozanimod 0.92\nmg group and 3/4 [75%] in the ozanimod 0.46 mg group) recovered to levels \u2265 0.2 x 109/L while on\ntreatment.\nLymphocyte counts collected from approximately 200 subjects following discontinuation of study drug\nallowed for a post hoc assessment of off-treatment recovery of ALC).\nBased on the Kaplan-Meier estimate, the median time to recovery of ALC to the normal range (\u2265 1 x\n109/L) was 30 days after treatment discontinuation in the ozanimod 0.92 mg treatment group and 28\ndays after treatment discontinuation in the ozanimod 0.46 mg treatment group. In the ozanimod 0.92\nmg treatment group, approximately 80% of subjects recovered to the normal range 2 months after\ntreatment discontinuation and approximately 90% recovered to the normal range 3 months after\ntreatment discontinuation. In the ozanimod 0.46 mg treatment group, approximately 80% of subjects\nrecovered to the normal range approximately 35 days after treatment discontinuation and\napproximately 90% of subjects recovered to the normal range 2 months after treatment\ndiscontinuation.\nCholesterol/lipoprotein\nModest, dose-dependent, non-progressive increases from baseline in total cholesterol and low-\ndensity lipoprotein (LDL) levels were observed at Month 6 with ozanimod 0.92 mg and 0.46 mg\nrelative to IFN \u03b2-1a. These changes were accompanied by corresponding increases in high-density\nlipoprotein (HDL) and no meaningful changes in triglyceride levels.\nDepression and suicidal ideation or behaviour\nAcross the ozanimod programme, the incidence of depression and suicidal ideation or behaviour was\ninfrequent, balanced across the treatment groups, and consistent with the background rates of these\nevents for the MS patient population.\nPregnancy/Lactation\nNon-clinical toxicology data suggest that ozanimod may - like other S1P receptor modulators - harm\nthe unborn baby. As long as no sufficient clinical data with ozanimod are available, and as long as the\nresults with S1P receptor modulators are inconclusive, pregnancy is a contraindication for the\ntreatment of ozanimod. A follow-up on pregnancy outcomes in the development programme for\nozanimod in the post-marketing setting as well as in the clinical trial programme (ongoing open-label\nextension study) is mandatory to gather sufficient data on this topic.\nAvailable pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of ozanimod/metabolites in milk.\nPhysicochemical data suggest the excretion of ozanimod and/or its metabolites in human milk. A risk\nto newborns/infants cannot be excluded.",

Post-hoc analyses of patient populations with differing baseline levels of\ndisease activity, including active and highly active disease, showed that the efficacy of ozanimod on\nclinical and imaging endpoints was consistent with the overall population.\nIndependently of the DMT-status, efficacy for ozanimod on CDP (-3M and -6M) was not\ndemonstrated. This is in line with the original analysis of the key secondary endpoint \u201cconfirmed\ndisability progression\u201d at 3 months (p=0.7651) and 6 months (p=0.1126).\nIn general, an effective treatment intended to modify the natural course of relapsing (remitting)\nmultiple sclerosis has to show an effect on both relapses and progression. Since an active\ncomparator was chosen in the clinical studies, an effect that has not shown statistical significance can\nbe accepted as long as it is described in the label accordingly.\nBesides the assessment of ARR and disability progression, the assessment of NEDA (no evidence of\ndisease activity) is of interest in evaluating new drugs for multiple sclerosis.\nThe applicant conducted the requested pooled analysis of NEDA-4 (no relapses, no EDSS\nprogression, no new or enlarging T2 lesions, no new GdE lesions, and annualised brain volume loss\n\u2264 0.4%). A treatment effect in favour of ozanimod 0.92 mg versus IFN \u03b2-1a was observed for NEDA-4\nat Months 12 and 24 in these post hoc analyses.\n20.7% (non-responder imputation, 24.5% observed cases) and 22.7% (observed cases) in the\nozanimod 0.92 mg treatment group versus 16.7% (20.4% observed cases) and 14.8% treated with\nIFN \u03b2-1a fulfilled the NEDA 4 criteria in the pooled analyses of both pivotal studies after 12 and 24\nmonths, respectively.\nPatients who completed the Phase 3 SUNBEAM and RADIANCE studies could enter an open-label\nextension study (Study 3 - DAYBREAK).\nAs of the data cutoff date of 30 June 2018, a total of 2,494 subjects had been enrolled and treated.\nThe majority of the subjects were ongoing (2,323 [93.1%] subjects), and 172 (6.9%) subjects had\ndiscontinued the study. The most frequent reason for discontinuation was voluntary withdrawal in 91\n[3.6%] of subjects.\n760 subjects were dosed with ozanimod 0.92 mg for up to 5 years, including up to 24 months in the\ncontrolled Phase 3 studies and up to 30 months in the Phase 3 OLE (Study RPC01-3001). There\nwere 398 subjects (52%) with at least 3 years, and 44 subjects (6%) with at least 4 years of ozanimod\n0.92 mg treatment.\nOf the 751 patients initially randomised to ozanimod 0.92 mg and treated for up to 3 years, the\n(adjusted) ARR was 0.124 after the second year of treatment.\nThe applicant was requested to provide an updated report of the ongoing open-label long-term follow\nup study DAYBREAK.

        "summary": "The efficacy of Zeposia, with the active substance ozanimod, was investigated in two studies. The first study, SUNBEAM, with 1,346 patients, lasted one year. The second, RADIANCE, with 1,313 patients, lasted two years.\nBoth studies compared the active substance ozanimod with a known multiple sclerosis treatment called interferon beta-1a. In these studies, participants were monitored for relapses and the number and size of lesions in the brain and spinal cord. Lesions are areas of damage which become visible on MRI images as the disease progresses.\nThe average number of relapses was significantly lower in participants who received the active substance ozanimod than in those who received the standard treatment. The number and size of lesions were also smaller in the ozanimod group. However, there was no significant difference in the rate of progression of disability between those treated with ozanimod and those treated with interferon beta-1a.\n",

It only\nhas a minor effect on the other S1P receptors (S1P2-4).\nThe application of ozanimod is based on two double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled pivotal\nparallel-group studies (SUNBEAM, RADIANCE).\nThe proposed indication was initially RMS. Since the majority of the study population (98.2%) had\nRRMS the indication was revised accordingly.\nTreatment with ozanimod 0.92 mg showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful differences\nrelative to the active comparator IFN \u03b2-1a in all relapse-based and MRI measures of MS disease\nactivity in both pivotal studies.\nSwissPAR\nThe secondary endpoints CDP-3M and CDP-6M were not statistically significant for both doses of\nozanimod. This might be explained by the relatively short duration of the controlled study phase (12\nmonths, 24 months) and the choice of an active comparator.\nA numerical dose-dependent effect was observed favouring the 0.92 mg dose over the 0.46 mg dose\nin both studies.\nOzanimod demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and was generally well tolerated with\napproximately 90% completion rates in the pivotal studies.\nPotential risks [e.g. bradycardia, liver injury, infections (with/without prolonged lymphopenia), macular\noedema, PRES, PML, long-term risk of malignancy, effects of withdrawal/rebound] are addressed in\nthe information for healthcare professionals.\nWith the help of the selected dose escalation regimen the cardiac safety profile is improved to a\ncertain extent. Despite that, there is still a remaining risk of bradyarrhythmia. An ECG is to be\nperformed in all patients in order to establish the presence of pre-existing cardiac abnormalities. In\npatients with certain pre-existing conditions, first-dose monitoring is recommended.\nBased on post-marketing data, the possibility that recommendations on first-dose monitoring will have\nto be adjusted later on cannot be ruled out.\nNon-clinical toxicology data suggest that ozanimod may harm the unborn baby. As long as clinical\nexperience is insufficient to reach a final recommendation, pregnancy and lactation are\ncontraindications for the treatment of ozanimod. A follow-up on pregnancy outcomes in the\ndevelopment programme for ozanimod in the post-marketing setting as well as in the clinical trial\nprogramme (ongoing open-label extension study) is mandatory to gather sufficient data on this topic.\nIn conclusion, the benefit / risk assessment of ozanimod in the indication \"Zeposia is indicated for the\ntreatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.\" is considered to be positive.",

        "full-text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, predominantly immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the\ncentral nervous system (CNS), affecting approximately 2.5 million individuals worldwide.\nMS is characterised by autoreactive lymphocytes that attack and destroy the myelin sheath\nsurrounding nerve cells, resulting in demyelination, axonal damage and disruption of the blood-brain\nbarrier, causing neurological impairment and severe disability.\nThe prevalence is 100-150 per 100,000 inhabitants. Around 8,000-10,000 people with MS live in\nSwitzerland (CH). The annual incidence is circa 3.5\u20135 per 100,000 inhabitants (CH: 4.0\u20135.5 /\n100,000) and is increasing according to data from Scandinavian registries.\nClinically, MS starts in approximately 85% of patients as relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), with variable\ndisease activity interspersed with periods of stability. The onset of RRMS typically occurs between the\nages of 20 and 40 and predominantly affects women (2 to 3 times more frequently than men).\nApproximately 70% of patients with RRMS develop, within the first 10 to 15 years after diagnosis, a\nsecondary progressive MS (SPMS), which is characterised by worsening of disability in the absence\nor independent of relapses.\nRelapsing forms of MS (RMS) include patients with RRMS, patients with clinically isolated syndrome\n(CIS \u2013 refers to the first clinical event and evidence of dissemination of lesions in time and space on\nthe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan) and those with SPMS with superimposed relapses.\nThere are no clear criteria that mark the transition from RRMS to SPMS.\nAdditionally, around 15% of patients demonstrate progressive neurological deterioration without\nsuperimposed relapses at the beginning of the disease. This form is called primary progressive MS\n(PPMS), begins typically in the 4th or 5th decade of life and affects men equally as women.\nThe current therapeutic approach of treating RMS involves symptomatic treatment, treatment of acute\nrelapses, and disease modifying therapies (DMTs). The goal of a DMT is to modify the natural course\nof disease by reducing the rate of relapses and MRI disease activity, and delay disability progression.\nThere are a number of DMTs available for the treatment of MS with different mechanisms of\naction and differentiated efficacy and safety profiles, but there is still no cure available for MS.\nSphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulation has been shown to be a highly effective\ntreatment for MS (Brinkman, 2010). Antagonism of S1P receptor type 1 (S1P1) inhibits the egress of\nlymphocytes from lymph nodes, thereby decreasing circulating lymphocytes (Scott, 2016; Tran,\n2017), and preclinical evidence suggests that S1P1 and sphingosine 1-phosphate 5 receptor (S1P5)\nmodulation also may have direct CNS effects resulting in reduction of inflammatory cytokines,\ndemyelination, and axonal loss, and preservation of GABAergic transmission. (Gentile, 2016; Groves,\n2013; Slowik, 2015).\nOzanimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist, which binds with high affinity and\nselectively to S1P subtypes 1 (S1P1) and 5 (S1P5). It is 10-fold more selective for S1P1 relative to\nS1P5 and has little activity on the other S1P receptors (S1P2, S1P3, and S1P4). Ozanimod causes\ninternalisation of S1P1 and retention of lymphocytes in the lymphoid tissues, as evidenced by a dose-\ndependent reduction in peripheral lymphocyte count.",
        "summary": "Ozanimod, the active substance in Zeposia, is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator. Ozanimod works by retaining lymphocytes, disease-fighting white blood cells, within the tissues that create them, such as lymph nodes and the spleen.\nIt is believed that ozanimod is effective because the lymphocytes held back in the lymphatic tissue are unable to cross the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system.\nBy preventing lymphocytes from reaching the central nervous system, ozanimod reduces the inflammatory reactions that damage the brain and spinal cord.",

Study treatment was administered until disease progression,\nunacceptable toxicity, more than two dose reductions, or treatment delay longer than 3 weeks.\nDisease was radiologically assessed prior to study entry, then every two cycles until cycle 6, and\nthereafter every three cycles. Patients were followed up until death.\nThe primary endpoint of the study was objective response rate (ORR) in treated patients as assessed\nby the investigator, which was defined as a percentage of patients with confirmed complete or partial\nresponse according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 in all treated\npatients. Other relevant endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR),\nand overall survival (OS). ORR, DOR, and PFS were additionally assessed by the independent\nreview committee (IRC).\nOverall, 110 participants were enrolled in the SCLC cohort of the study, of whom 105 received study\ntreatment. Three patients were not treated due to rapid disease progression, one patient was not\ntreated due to increased AST \u22653xULN (upper limit of normal) and one patient was not able to take\npart in required visits.\n4 Bunn PA, Nugent JL, Matthews MJ.

        "full-text": "Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a histological subtype of lung cancer that is defined by poor\nsurvival prognosis. Although most patients with metastatic disease initially respond to platinum-based\ntherapy, the vast majority of patients will relapse and/or progress after the initial treatment. There has\nbeen a lack of advancements in the second-line setting for decades. Monotherapy with\ntopoisomerase inhibitor is associated with a high frequency of haematological toxicities. There is an\nunmet medical need for a therapy option with a more favourable safety profile that improves the\nsurvival outcomes of these patients.\nThe pivotal data to support the requested indication are based on 105 patients from the SCLC cohort\nof the Phase 2 single-arm Study PM1183-B-005-14. This study included SCLC patients after\nplatinum-based chemotherapy, but excluded patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases.\nThe exclusion of patients with CNS involvement is considered to be relevant because it is a common\nmetastatic site for SCLC and is associated with exceptionally poor prognosis.\nThe final analysis demonstrated an independent review committee confirmed overall response rate of\n33.7% and median overall survival of 10.2 months in the patient population relevant to the authorised\nindication. These results are considered to be clinically meaningful in the context of the published\ndata for the current standard of care5. However, the major limitation of the pivotal study results\npresented is the lack of a randomised control arm.\nIn order to provide confirmatory evidence to support the conversion from a temporary authorisation to\na regular authorisation, the applicant commits to provide results from a Phase 3 Study PM1183-C-\n008-21, which directly compares lurbinectedin monotherapy or lurbinectedin combined with irinotecan\nversus either topotecan or irinotecan in post-platinum SCLC patients with CTFI \u226530 days.\nRegarding safety, the most frequent treatment emergent adverse events in the Study PM1183-B-005-\n14 SCLC cohort were fatigue, nausea, dyspnoea, constipation and decreased appetite. The most\ncommon grade \u22653 haematological toxicities were neutropenia, lymphopenia, leukopenia, anaemia\nand thrombocytopenia. The reported adverse drug reactions for lurbinectedin are consistent with\nother alkylating agents. Phase 3 Study PM1183-C-004-14 of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer\npatients, in which lurbinectedin was directly compared with topotecan, provided additional supportive\nevidence. In this study haematological adverse events were numerically less frequent and less severe\nin patients treated with lurbinectedin compared with topotecan. Grade \u22653 haematological toxicities, in\nparticular neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, were less frequent in patients treated with\nlurbinectedin compared with topotecan. Patients in the lurbinectedin arm also required less supportive\nmeasures compared with topotecan-treated patients.\nIn conclusion, the efficacy results for lurbinectedin are considered clinically meaningful in the context\nof published data for the current standard of care, especially considering the poor survival outcomes\nand the lack of therapeutic advancements for decades in the requested second-line SCLC indication5\n.\nSafety analyses of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients demonstrate a more favourable toxicity\nprofile for lurbinectedin compared with topotecan. The main weakness of the submitted dossier is the\nlack of direct comparison of lurbinectedin 3.2 mg/m2 every 3 weeks compared to topotecan in SCLC\npatients. Study PM1183-C-008-21 (LAGOON) will be required as confirmatory evidence for the\nconversion of a temporary to a regular marketing authorisation for the requested indication.",
        "summary": "Patients with SCLC have a poor chance of survival. Although those affected initially respond well to platinum-based chemotherapy, many SCLC patients suffer a relapse or progression of the disease. No progress has been made in second-line treatment for these patient groups in decades. The current standard second-line treatment is toxic. There is therefore a great medical need for other treatment options. Zepzelca has been authorised as an orphan drug.

Swissmedic has authorised the medicinal product Zepzelca temporarily in Switzerland (in accordance with Art. 9a TPA) since not all clinical trials were available or had been concluded at the time of authorisation. The temporary authorisation is contingent on the timely submission of the data requested by Swissmedic.

        "full-text": "The scope of this Inquiry has been exceptionally wide in four particular ways: (1) the scale of the harm: the number of those infected amounts to tens of thousands, many of whom have died (and continue to die); (2) the geographical scope, encompassing as it does all four nations within the United Kingdom; (3) the timeframe: since the NHS began, exploring over five decades of decisionmaking, action and inaction; (4) the remit, which has been to examine not only the events which caused or contributed to the infection of so many people (“what happened and why”?) but also the response of government, the NHS and others in the decades following the transmission of infection, and how that response has compounded the harms already inflicted. I shall say a little more in this Introduction about each of these aspects. As to scale, more than 3,000 deaths are attributable to infected blood and blood products. Around 380 children with bleeding disorders were infected with HIV, a third of the 1,250 people with bleeding disorders infected with HIV, with the majority also being coinfected with Hepatitis C and some with Hepatitis B and other infections as well. Three quarters of those with bleeding disorders who were infected with HIV have died. Between 80 and possibly up to about 100 people were infected with HIV through transfusions. About 85% of those have died. Around 26,800 people were infected with Hepatitis C through blood transfusions between 1970 and 1991, of whom about 22,000 were chronically infected beyond the initial six months, with 2,700 surviving to the end of 2019. Between 2,400 and 5,000 people with bleeding disorders were infected with Hepatitis C without being infected with HIV, but sometimes with Hepatitis B and other infections as well. There is insufficient evidence to estimate the numbers of people infected with Hepatitis B through blood and blood products. There were five recorded cases of confirmed or probable blood-borne variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (“vCJD”) infections. Three were symptomatic and all have died. It is important not to lose sight of the fact that behind those statistics are individuals, each with a story of suffering and loss that is personal to them. People infected and affected have told powerful stories of pain, sickness and loss, of lives damaged and destroyed, unrecognisable from before their infection and unrecognisable from all their hopes and dreams for their lives. Each person who has felt able to give evidence and each person who has supported them and continues to provide support and solidarity through the ongoing suffering and loss deserves respect. This account builds on their accounts, taken together with the evidence and input of all others who have participated in this Inquiry: participants not only in name but in a collective endeavour. As to geographical remit, this Inquiry has sought to examine, as far as possible, relevant decision-making in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is right to note, however, that many of the decisions and actions which this Report examines were taken in Westminster, by the UK government. The available evidence suggests that for the most part, and certainly in the period prior to legislative and executive devolution, Wales and Northern Ireland (and to a lesser extent Scotland) followed the path charted by the Department of Health.3  That is inevitably reflected in the focus of some of the chapters in this Report. The timeframe examined by this Report is extensive, covering over five decades of decisionmaking.4  That has brought with it additional challenges, as has the fact that an inquiry did not take place at a much earlier stage.5  Documents that existed years ago no longer exist.6 There are individuals, from government, from the medical profession, from pharmaceutical companies and elsewhere, who played an important part in events, from whom the Inquiry has been unable to hear, either because they are dead or because of impairments of health or age. Some of those who did give evidence had little independent memory of events, save to the extent that they were prompted by contemporaneous documents. Notwithstanding these challenges it has been possible in this Report to reach conclusions on the central questions raised by the Inquiry’s Terms of Reference. The broad remit of the Inquiry is reflected in the structure of this Report. The Report begins with an examination of impact, through a narrative of the experiences of people who were infected and affected,7  and with an analysis of events at Treloar’s, which both illustrates and highlights the nature of, and many of the reasons for, the national treatment disaster which was infected blood.8  The Report then looks at the question of “What happened and why?”. through an examination of the actions and inactions of governments,9  the blood transfusion services,10 haemophilia centres and their directors,11 and pharmaceutical companies,12 and an examination of transfusion practices.13 It considers specific areas where opportunities to reduce risk were missed, such as the failure to achieve self-sufficiency in England and Wales,14 the failure to introduce surrogate screening for either HIV or Hepatitis C,15 and the delays in introducing screening for HIV and for Hepatitis C.16 The Report then turns to consider how governments, the NHS and others responded to the infections of so many people. Amongst other matters it looks at the refusal over decades to provide compensation and the decision-making that led (after delays) to agreements in principle to establish ex gratia payment schemes;17 the ways in which those schemes (the Alliance House Organisations) operated and their replacement with national support schemes;18 difficulties in accessing appropriate treatment and care;19 problems created by missing or incomplete or inaccurate medical records;20 and the defensiveness of government, through its publication of a self-sufficiency chronology, its repeated use of indefensible lines to take and its refusal over decades to hold a public inquiry.21 The picture that emerges overall from the findings in this Report is one in which people have been failed, not once but repeatedly, by their doctors, by the bodies (NHS and other) responsible for the safety of their treatment, and by their governments. Six particular themes are prominent. The first is the failure to make patient safety the paramount focus of decision-making and of action – whether it be decisions by individual clinicians, haemophilia centres or hospitals, or decisions taken at a regional level by transfusion centres, or decisions taken at a national level by governments. The second theme is the slow and protracted nature of much of the decision-making examined in this Report: by way of example, the length of time taken for haemophilia centres to adapt treatment policies and practices, or the length of time taken by clinicians and NHS organisations to recognise the need for better transfusion practice, or the delays with regard to AIDS donor leaflets, or the delayed decision-making by government regarding the introduction of Hepatitis C screening of blood donations and the delay in deciding to undertake a lookback.The third is the profoundly unethical lack of respect for individual patient autonomy, which will be most starkly apparent to readers from the chapters on People’s Experiences and Treloar’s and from parts of the chapters on Haemophilia Centres: Policies and Practice and Blood Transfusion: Clinical Practice. The fourth theme, closely related to the third, speaks of the dangers of clinical freedom. Clinical freedom is the idea that doctors should be free to do what they believe to be right for an individual patient. But the danger of clinical freedom in the context of infected blood and blood products is that it allowed doctors to follow unsafe treatment policies and practices (such as administering commercial factor concentrates to young children, or giving unnecessary transfusions to postpartum women), and it meant that others (in particular the health departments and Chief Medical Officers) held back from providing advice, guidance or information in the misguided belief that this would interfere with clinical freedom. The fifth theme is that of institutional defensiveness, from the NHS and in particular from government, compounded by groupthink amongst civil servants and ministers, and a lack of transparency and candour. These factors drove the response of government over the decades. The institutional defensiveness identified above is damaging to the public interest. But the sixth principal theme that emerges from this Report is the damage that was done by that defensiveness and the accompanying lack of transparency and candour to the very people whose lives had been destroyed by infection. The harms already done to them were compounded by the refusal to accept responsibility and offer accountability, the refusal to give the answers that people fervently sought, the refusal to provide compensation, leaving people struggling and in desperate circumstances, the thoughtless repetition of unjustified and misleading lines to take, and the lack of any real recognition and of any meaningful apology. The purpose of this Overview is to provide a chapter-by-chapter summary to help readers navigate the Report.22 Some chapters lend themselves relatively easily to a neat summary; others tell a more multifactorial story, sometimes spanning decades, and are harder to compress. The summaries below are not intended as a substitute for reading the individual chapters, but will perhaps help readers to identify the chapters that are of the most importance or relevance to them. Where conclusions are expressed in a chapter they may be more nuanced than appears from the short summary given here, and the context against which they are drawn should be read if the conclusions are to be fully appreciated. In the course of some of the Overview, abbreviations or acronyms are used: such as UKHCDO (UK Haemophilia Centre Directors’ Organisation) or ACVSB (Advisory Committee on the Virological Safety of Blood). They are explained when they first appear in the text and used for brevity thereafter – but a glossary and brief chronology come at the end, for ease of reference.",
        "summary": "Patients have received blood or blood products from the NHS since it began in 1948. Many of those treated with them, particularly between 1970 and 1998, died or suffered miserably, and many continue to suffer. This was not as a direct result of the underlying condition or illness that took them to the NHS in the first place, but as a result of the treatment itself. This would be catastrophic enough if they were the only victims. But the treatment has caused others to suffer too – partners, family, children, friends – some by being themselves infected, some by having to watch loved ones die, some by having to give their lives to caring; and almost every one of them, infected and affected, suffering in almost every aspect of their lives. I have to report a catalogue of failures which caused this to happen. Each on its own is serious. Taken together they are a calamity. Lord Winston famously called these events “the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS”. I have to report that it could largely, though not entirely, have been avoided. And I have to report that it should have been. I have also to report systemic, collective and individual failures to deal ethically, appropriately, and quickly, with the risk of infections being transmitted in blood, with the infections when the risk materialised, and with the consequences for thousands of families. There were around 4,000 to 6,000 people with bleeding disorders in the UK at any one time. Around 1,250 were infected with HIV. The best estimate is that this included 380 children. Almost all infected with HIV were also infected with Hepatitis C and some with Hepatitis B and Hepatitis D as well. Three quarters of these 1,250 adults and children have died. A larger number still (between 2,400 and 5,000 people with bleeding disorders) who were not infected by HIV received blood products infected with one or more hepatitis viruses, and developed chronic Hepatitis C. People who were infected by transfusions, rather than by blood products, were infected in even greater numbers. Between 80 and 100 were infected with HIV after a blood transfusion. Approximately 26,800 were infected with Hepatitis C after a blood transfusion, often linked with childbirth or surgery, but also from transfusions to treat thalassemia, sickle disease, or leukaemia, or tissue transfer. It has not been possible to estimate the number of people infected with chronic Hepatitis B due to limited data. A significant number of people who received blood products and some who received blood transfusions have since been told that they are at an increased risk of vCJD, and should alert their medical practitioner or dentist prior to treatment. This in turn has compromised their access to that treatment. The scale of what happened is horrifying. The most accurate estimate is that more than 3,000 deaths are attributable to infected blood, blood products and tissue. To understand the failings, it is necessary to set out the reasoning behind my conclusions in some detail. They need to be explained and set in context. That will follow in the chapters of this Report. What follows makes for hard reading. For now, though, the headline points are these: The principal infections considered by the Inquiry are Hepatitis (B and C) and HIV. The transmission of vCJD is also considered. It was well known from at least the early 1940s, and became clear beyond doubt in the mid1940s, that blood transfusions or the use of plasma could transmit “serum hepatitis”. It was known that this could be fatal, or lead to serious long-term disease, liver failure, cirrhosis and cancer. The virus responsible for Hepatitis B was identified by the early 1970s. The virus responsible for Hepatitis C was not identified until 1988, but it was apparent at least from the mid 1970s that non-A non-B Hepatitis (as it was known prior to 1988) was responsible for the majority of post-transfusion hepatitis cases and that just as Hepatitis B could have serious long-term consequences, so too might non-A non-B Hepatitis. Awareness of AIDS began in 1981, and it was apparent by mid 1982 that whatever was causing AIDS might be transmissible by blood and blood products.",

The genetic modifications do not raise safety concerns, except for the presence of a multicopy plasmid carrying known antimicrobial resistance genes. However, based on the absence of viable cells and   from the production organism in the food enzyme, this is not considered to be a risk. The food enzyme is intended to be used in starch processing for the production of glucose syrups. Toxicological studies and dietary exposure estimation were not considered necessary. Similarity of the amino acid sequence to those of known allergens was searched and one match was found. The Panel considered that, under the intended conditions of use, the risk of allergic sensitisation and elicitation reactions by dietary exposure cannot be excluded, but the likelihood for this to occur is considered to be low.

The list of those substances is established in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 686/2012. Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 is one of the active substances listed in Regulation (EU) No 686/2012.In accordance with Article 1 of Regulation (EU) No 844/2012, the rapporteur Member State (RMS), Denmark, and co‐rapporteur Member State (co‐RMS), the Netherlands, received an application from Certis USA LLC for the renewal of approval of the active substance Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12.An initial evaluation of the dossier on Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 was provided by the RMS in the renewal assessment report (RAR) and subsequently, a peer review of the pesticide risk assessment on the RMS evaluation was conducted by EFSA in accordance with Article 13 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/1659. The following conclusions are derived.The uses of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 according to the representative uses as an insecticide on pome fruits (field use), tomato (including permanent greenhouses and walk‐in tunnels) and ornamentals (field use), as proposed at EU level result in a sufficient insecticidal efficacy against the target lepidopteran pests.The assessment of the data package revealed no issues that could not be finalised or that need to be included as critical areas of concern with respect to identity, biological properties of the active substance and physical and technical properties of the representative formulation.With respect to mammalian toxicology, two data gaps are identified in relationship to potential adverse effects after repeated exposure by inhalation to Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 and to potential genotoxic effect of the insecticidal proteins by non‐dietary exposure. On this basis, the risk assessment for residents and bystanders cannot be concluded (issue not finalised).In the area of residues, a data gap was identified related to the proposed threshold of 1 × 105 colony‐forming units (CFU)/g for viable residues on edible plant commodities at the time of harvest, where quantification of viable counts linked to specific preharvest intervals (PHIs) is requested to finalise the consumer risk assessment.Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 is not proposed to be included into Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.In the area of environmental fate and behaviour, the available information was considered sufficient to complete the necessary environmental exposure assessments.Satisfactory information was not provided leading to issues not being finalised for the potential effects to honeybee larvae, for the potential for infectivity and pathogenicity to bees and non‐target arthropods for representative field and walk‐in tunnel uses; for the potential for toxicity, infectivity and pathogenicity to earthworms and potential adverse effects to soil microorganisms for representative field and walk‐in tunnel uses and for a hazard characterisation and an assessment of the risk to non‐target organisms from toxins/secondary metabolites such as crystal proteins present after the application of the product.Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/20121 as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/16592 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Regulation’), lays down the provisions for the procedure of the renewal of the approval of active substances, submitted under Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/20093. This regulates for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) the procedure for organising the consultation of Member States, the applicant and the public on the initial evaluation provided by the rapporteur Member State (RMS) and/or co‐rapporteur Member State (co‐RMS) in the renewal assessment report (RAR), and the organisation of an expert consultation where appropriate.In accordance with Article 13 of the Regulation, unless formally informed by the European Commission that a conclusion is not necessary, EFSA is required to adopt a conclusion on whether the active substance can be expected to meet the approval criteria provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 within 5 months from the end of the period provided for the submission of written comments, subject to an extension of an additional 3 months where additional information is required to be submitted by the applicant in accordance with Article 13(3).In accordance with Article 1 of the Regulation, the RMS, Denmark, and co‐RMS, the Netherlands, received an application from Certis USA LLC for the renewal of approval of the active substance Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12. Complying with Article 8 of the Regulation, the RMS checked the completeness of the dossier and informed the applicant, the co‐RMS (the Netherlands), the European Commission and EFSA about the admissibility.The RMS provided its initial evaluation of the dossier on Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 in the RAR, which was received by EFSA on 2 April 2019 (Denmark, 2019).In accordance with Article 12 of the Regulation, EFSA distributed the RAR to the Member States and the applicant, Certis USA LLC, for consultation and comments on 14 May 2019. EFSA also provided comments. In addition, EFSA conducted a public consultation on the RAR. EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the European Commission on 14 July 2019. At the same time, the collated comments were forwarded to the RMS for compilation and evaluation in the format of a reporting table. The applicant was invited to respond to the comments in column 3 of the reporting table. The comments and the applicant's response were evaluated by the RMS in column 3.The need for expert consultation and the necessity for additional information to be submitted by the applicant in accordance with Article 13(3) of the Regulation were considered in a telephone conference between EFSA, the RMS on 10 October 2019. On the basis of the comments received, the applicant's response to the comments and the RMS's evaluation thereof, it was concluded that additional information should be requested from the applicant, and that EFSA should conduct an expert consultation in the areas of mammalian toxicology, residues and environmental fate and behaviour.The outcome of the telephone conference, together with EFSA's further consideration of the comments, is reflected in the conclusions set out in column 4 of the reporting table. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase and which required further consideration, including those issues to be considered in an expert consultation, were compiled by EFSA in the format of an evaluation table.The conclusions arising from the consideration by EFSA, and as appropriate by the RMS, of the points identified in the evaluation table, together with the outcome of the expert consultation and the written consultation on the assessment of additional information, where these took place, were reported in the final column of the evaluation table.A final consultation on the conclusions arising from the peer review of the risk assessment took place with Member States via a written procedure in August–September 2020.This conclusion report summarises the outcome of the peer review of the risk assessment of the active substance and the representative formulation evaluated on the basis of the representative uses of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 as an insecticide on pome fruits (field use), protected tomato (including permanent greenhouses and walk‐in tunnels) and ornamentals (field use), as proposed by the applicant. In accordance with Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, risk mitigation options identified in the RAR and considered during the peer review are presented in the conclusion. A list of the relevant end points for the active substance and the formulation is provided in Appendix A.In addition, a key supporting document to this conclusion is the peer review report (EFSA, 2020), which is a compilation of the documentation developed to evaluate and address all issues raised in the peer review, from the initial commenting phase to the conclusion. The peer review report comprises the following documents, in which all views expressed during the course of the peer review, including minority views, where applicable, can be found:\n\nthe comments received on the RAR;\nthe reporting table (17 October 2019);\nthe evaluation table (14 September 2020);\nthe report(s) of the scientific consultation with Member State experts (where relevant);\nthe comments received on the assessment of the additional information (where relevant);\nthe comments received on the draft EFSA conclusion.\nGiven the importance of the RAR, including its revisions (Denmark, 2020), and the peer review report, both documents are considered as background documents to this conclusion and thus are made publicly available.It is recommended that this conclusion report and its background documents would not be accepted to support any registration outside the EU for which the applicant has not demonstrated that it has regulatory access to the information on which this conclusion report is based.Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 is a bacterium deposited at the ARS Culture Collection (Northern Regional Research Laboratory; NRRL), at the Microbial Properties Research Unit, National Centre for Agricultural Utilization Research, Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture Peoria, Illinois, USA, under the deposit number NRRL B‐30791. Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 is a naturally occurring, indigenous wild‐type bacterium, initially isolated from the insect Ephestia cantella.The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ‘CoStar WG’, a water‐dispersible granule (WG) containing 850 g/kg of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 (specified minimum content 8.5 × 1012 colony‐forming units (CFU)/kg and maximum 5.7 × 1013 CFU/kg) with a minimum target bio‐potency of 90,000 IU/mg.The representative uses evaluated were field spray applications for the biological control of insect pests of the order of Lepidoptera on pome fruits and ornamentals and on protected tomato (including permanent greenhouses and walk‐in tunnels). Full details of the good agriculture practices (GAPs) can be found in the list of end points in Appendix A.Data were submitted to conclude that the use of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 according to the representative uses proposed at EU level results in a sufficient insecticidal efficacy against the target organisms, following the guidance document SANCO/2012/11251‐rev. 4 (European Commission, 2014b).The following guidance documents were followed in the production of this conclusion: European Commission, 2012 and EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 2018.The technical grade microbial pest control agent (MPCA) is only a hypothetical stage in the continuous production process of the end‐use product (microbial pest control product; MPCP). As a consequence, the specification is given only for the formulated product ‘CoStar WG’ of minimum content of 8.5 × 1012 CFU/kg (maximum 5.7 × 1013 CFU/kg) with a minimum bio‐potency of 90,000 IU/mg.Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 is characterised by serotyping, plasmid profiling, activity spectrum, fatty acid analysis, DNA fingerprinting (amplified fragment length polymorphism; AFLP) and cry toxin analysis. To allow an unequivocal identification of strain SA‐12, strain‐specific primers based on the sequences of the whole genome and plasmids of strain SA‐12 were developed. The developed markers were tested for specificity with a set of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki, aizawai, israelensis and tenebrionis, as well as with potentially pathogenic Bacillus cereus strains. Two specific primer pairs were unique for Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 and can be used for identification at strain level.Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 contains genes encoding for potential production of cytotoxin type K2 (CytK2), six crystal insecticidal proteins (Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry1Ia, Cry2Aa, Cry2Ab), two Cry‐like proteins and one vegetative insecticidal protein (VIP 3Aa10). Furthermore, Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 has the potential to form a non‐haemolytic (Nhe) and haemolytic (Hbl) enterotoxin complex (which also includes CytK2). The genes for the highly cytotoxic Cyt K1, for the cytotoxic variant of haemolysin II (HlyII), for cereulide and for ß‐exotoxins are missing in the strain. In addition, it has been demonstrated that compared to a pathogenic Bacillus cereus strain (whose group it is member), the enterotoxins Nhe and Hbl are produced at significantly lower levels under optimal growth conditions in enriched substrate favouring enterotoxin production.The content of microbial contaminants of the MPCP was below the limits defined in the SANCO/12116/2012 working document (European Commission, 2012). Bacillus thuringiensis spores can remain viable for years in soil, but applied as a spray, the δ‐endotoxins are rapidly degradable and endospores are rapidly inactivated when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation.As a member of the Bacillus cereus‐group, Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki is closely related to Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus cereus. Bacillus thuringiensis strains are, however, distinguishable from Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthracis.Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 was shown to be sensitive to all relevant antibiotics as provided in EFSA FEEDAP Panel Guidance (2018): chloramphenicol, tetracycline, streptomycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, kanamycin, gentamicin and vancomycin.The main data regarding the identity of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 and its biological properties are given in Appendix A.Acceptable methods for CFU counts of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 in the formulation for the determination of the microorganism in the MPCP and for the determination of the content of contaminating microorganisms are available.Methods for the determination and quantification of residues are currently not required as no residue definition applies to the microorganism and no maximum residue level (MRL) was set for any of the intended uses. However, it is noted that a validated enumeration method in high water commodities (lettuce) was provided with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1.3 × 103 CFU/g, and for unambiguous identification of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12, an AFLP method with two highly specific primer pairs is available. The strain‐specific molecular markers can be used for monitoring of the strain upon field application.Methods of analysis for viable residues in the environment are not required.Quantification of Cry1Ab in soil can be done with commercial enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit with an LOQ of 0.25 μg/L. Determination of Cry1Ab in water can be done with ELISA with a detection limit of 2.1 ng/L.Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 was discussed at the Pesticides Peer Review Meeting Teleconference 25 in March 2020.\nGeneral data\nFrom the medical data, no adverse reactions in individuals as a result of contact with Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 during its development, manufacture, preparation or field application have been documented or reported. The results of allergenicity observations indicate that increased IgE levels can occur in greenhouses workers exposed to products containing Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki, but no effect on the occurrence of respiratory symptoms or lung function was observed.Bacillus thuringiensis is not recommended for the Qualified Presumption of Safety list (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2020).\nToxicity/Infectivity/Pathogenicity studies\nAs the available methods for testing dermal sensitisation are not suitable for testing microorganisms and there are no validated test methods for sensitisation by inhalation, the following warning phrase is proposed: ‘Microorganisms may have the potential to provoke sensitising reactions’.Laboratory studies on mammalian toxicity testing an appropriate concentration of a liquid formulation of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 (Thuricide SC) have been conducted in rats upon oral, respiratory (intranasal) and intravenous acute single doses. Adverse effects and signs of infectivity or pathogenicity were not observed. Clearance occurred within 2 weeks.A dermal toxicity and a skin irritation study conducted with formulated Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐11 (Delfin WG, considered similar to CoStar WG) did not reveal any toxic or irritating effects. In an eye irritation study conducted with Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12, only transient slight conjunctival irritation was observed.Concerning repeated exposure toxicity, a lung interstitial inflammation was observed in mice after subchronic (14‐day) inhalation exposure to an appropriate concentration of formulated Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (strain HD‐1 in Dipel) and still present 70 days after the exposure. The potential concern for serious health effects after repeated exposure by inhalation could not be excluded on the basis of the available data (data gap).4 RMS and co‐RMS disagreed.\nSecondary metabolites/toxins\nBacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 has been shown to have the genes that would enable it to produce certain enterotoxins (see Section 1). Enterotoxins are inactivated at low pH; therefore, preformed enterotoxins are considered not relevant by oral exposure. Based on the available evidence, the peer review concluded that only the spores are able to survive the stomach passage and to germinate and produce enterotoxins in the intestinal tract (potentially leading to diarrhoeal‐associated food‐borne disease in humans). Considering the available evidence and uncertainties, the threshold of 105 CFU/g food as determined by the BIOHAZ Panel Opinion (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2016) to cover the risk of food‐borne poisonings caused by the Bacillus cereus group of microorganisms was concluded as applicable for the group of Bacillus thuringiensis by the majority of experts.5 The RMS and the co‐RMS disagreed.In a mouse micronucleus study with intraperitoneal administration, positive results were observed with the spore‐crystal complex containing Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac and Cry2Aa. These results were considered equivocal, especially regarding whether the Cry‐proteins had been solubilised/activated prior to administration or not (data gap). The majority of the experts concluded that genotoxicity of the insecticidal proteins is not a concern for dietary exposure but a possible concern for non‐dietary exposure could not be excluded.6\nReference values and exposure\nAs mentioned previously, the threshold of 105 CFU/g food as determined by the BIOHAZ Panel Opinion (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2016) is considered applicable to the group of Bacillus thuringiensis to cover the risk of food‐borne poisonings caused by the Bacillus cereus group of microorganisms. With regard to non‐dietary exposure, since toxicity/infectivity after repeated exposure by inhalation could not be concluded, and a genotoxic potential of the Cry proteins could not be excluded by non‐dietary exposure, the risk assessment by inhalation for residents and bystanders cannot be concluded (issue not finalised) while the use of respiratory protective equipment is recommended for operators and workers.Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 was discussed at the Pesticides Peer Review Meeting Teleconference 25 in March 2020.Considering the available evidence and uncertainties, the threshold of 105 CFU/g plant commodity at the time of harvest as determined by the BIOHAZ Panel Opinion (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2016) is considered applicable to all Bacillus thuringiensis strains to cover the risk of food‐borne poisonings (caused by the Bacillus cereus group of microorganisms; see Section 2). Non‐viable residues are not of concern for the dietary consumption (see Section 2). The co‐RMS wishes to inform that work is ongoing on the development of a new diagnostic tool to discriminate Bacillus thuringiensis biocontrol strains from Bacillus cereus sensu lato species and strains. The expectation is that a tool will be soon available to distinguish between Bacillus cereus senso lato strains and commercial Bacillus thuringiensis strains and to ensure correct conclusions and decisions can be taken with regard to the origin of food borne outbreaks.Therefore, only information on viable residues i.e. CFU per g or kg plant commodities at harvest is needed to demonstrate that the threshold of 105 CFU/g edible plant commodity is not exceeded.To ensure this, the setting of a PHI may be needed because available experimental data in lettuce (up to 2.2 × 105 CFU/g after treatment) and estimated counts on harvested pome fruits (up to 2.2 × 107 CFU/g) considering representative uses demonstrate that counts at harvest exceed this threshold. Since samples in the lettuce study were stored at ‐18 °C prior to analysis, a storage stability of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 in high‐water commodities is still required (data gap).Viable counts of commercial Bacillus thuringiensis strains including Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 were demonstrated in the scientific literature and by supporting experimental evidence to decline following application and not to persist or multiply on edible plant commodities (fruiting vegetable and leafy crops). Furthermore, in the literature a body of evidence supports inactivation and decline of viable spores by environmental factors such as solar radiation, rainfall, plant growth and temperature. Based on the available data in the RAR, a half‐life of viable spores of around one day or 24 h can reasonably be estimated.Considering the above‐mentioned threshold, a half‐life time of 24 h and estimated viable counts on pome fruits at harvest, a PHI of at least 8 days would be required. It is, however, to be noted that the representative uses on pome fruits and on tomatoes are indicating a BBCH of up to 89 which corresponds to the ripe fruits ready for consumption and a PHI was not specified and it can be assumed that the PHI is less than 8 days if this growth stage of application is maintained. Therefore, quantification of viable counts linked to specific PHIs is requested (data gap).This would still need to be addressed before a consumer risk assessment can be finalised.Because of the above‐mentioned data gaps and issue not finalised, Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 is not proposed to be included into Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/20057.Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 was discussed at the Pesticides Peer Review Meeting Teleconference 25 in March 2020.Satisfactory information was provided in relation to potential interference of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 with the analytical systems for the control of the quality of drinking water provided for in Directive 98/83/EC8 (see specific Annex VI decision‐making criteria in Part II Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/20119). It was concluded that Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 is unlikely to interfere with the methodologies routinely used for such determinations.Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 is a ‘wild type’ and there are no marker genes in the strain which would permit the analysis of a frequency of genetic exchange. As the genetic diversity and drift in the wild‐type population has not been ascertained, it would not be possible to distinguish any genetic drift from that in the wild population based on the information provided. Though it is acknowledged that the possibility and effects of transfer of genetic material are not different for Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 than for other naturally occurring Bacillus thuringiensis strains, transfer of genetic material by Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 after application is possible (the strain has plasmids), so could not be excluded based on the information in the dossier. Information in the dossier confirms that plasmid exchange between vegetative cells of different strains of the species can be measured when applications were made to leaf surfaces. Note the applied material in the product is spores and not vegetative cells.Specific environmental exposure estimates for greenhouse uses were not provided. The applicant chose to address the representative use on protected tomato by stating that greenhouse uses are covered by the exposure assessments provided for the field uses.A study on the toxicity and pathogenicity of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 to birds was available and did not indicate any adverse effects. Investigation of infectivity was not performed in the study. Based on the lack of toxicity and pathogenicity in the available study, a low risk to birds was concluded (relevant for all representative uses).As concluded in Section 2, sufficient information is available to finalise the assessment of infectivity and pathogenicity of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 in mammals. A low risk to wild mammals is concluded (relevant for all representative uses).Adequate studies were available with aquatic organisms showing no toxicity and pathogenicity to aquatic organisms from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12. In the study with Daphnia infectivity was not assessed. A high margin of safety was observed when comparing the endpoints with expected spore concentrations in the environment after entry into surface water from the intended field uses. Based on the lack of toxicity and pathogenicity in the available studies, a low risk to aquatic organisms was concluded for all representative uses.Insufficient data were available to address potential effects to honeybee larvae, infectivity and pathogenicity to honeybee from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12. Consequently, a data gap leading to an assessment not finalised was identified for the potential effects to honeybee larvae and for the infectivity and pathogenicity to honeybee from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 for the intended uses in open field and walk‐in tunnels. The co‐RMS disagreed with the data gap and issue not finalised identified for honeybees as the information available in the RAR was considered of sufficient length to conclude on the lack of infectivity and pathogenicity to honeybees. Low risk identified for representative uses in permanent greenhouses as the exposure to honeybees is expected to be negligible.Insufficient data were available to address infectivity and pathogenicity to non‐target arthropods from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12. Consequently, a data gap leading to an assessment not finalised was identified for the infectivity and pathogenicity of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 to non‐target arthropods for the intended uses in open field and walk‐in tunnels. For representative uses in permanent greenhouses, the risk is low as the exposure to non‐target arthropods is expected to be negligible.For representative uses in permanent greenhouses, an assessment to the soil compartment is not requested according to EFSA (EFSA, 2014). Insufficient data were available on earthworms to indicate if Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 would be toxic, infectious or pathogenic to earthworms. Consequently, a data gap leading to an assessment not finalised was identified for the toxicity, infectivity, pathogenicity of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 to earthworms for the intended uses in field and walk‐in tunnel. Insufficient data were available on soil microorganisms to indicate if Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 would cause adverse effects to soil microorganisms for the representative field uses. Consequently, a data gap leading to an assessment not finalised was identified for the toxicity of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 to soil microorganism for the intended use in open field and walk‐in tunnels. The RMS disagreed with the data gap and issue not finalised identified for earthworms and soil microorganisms and rather support a waiver.Adequate data were available and indicated that Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 is unlikely to cause adverse effects on non‐target plants, and therefore, a low risk to non‐target plants is concluded for all representative uses.The risk assessment of toxins/secondary metabolites such as crystal proteins could not be finalised for terrestrial‐ and aquatic non‐target organisms for the representative field and walk‐in tunnel uses. Toxicity data were not available to perform a hazard characterisation (resulting in data gap and issue not finalised). For non‐target aquatic organisms, exposure to surface water cannot be excluded for the representative use in permanent greenhouse (resulting in a data gap and issue not finalised).This is a list of data gaps identified during the peer review process, including those areas in which a study may have been made available during the peer review process but not considered for procedural reasons (without prejudice to the provisions of Article 56 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 concerning information on potentially harmful effects).\n\nFurther assessment of potential health effects after repeated exposure by inhalation to Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 should be provided (relevant for all representative uses, see Section 2).\nFurther assessment of the genotoxic potential of the insecticidal proteins by non‐dietary exposure should be provided (relevant for all representative uses, see Section 2).\nA storage stability of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain SA‐12 in high‐water plant commodities should be provided (relevant for pome fruits and tomato; see Section 3).\nQuantification of viable counts linked to specific PHIs is requested for the GAPs of the representative uses to demonstrate that the threshold of 105 CFU/g is respected at harvest (relevant for pome fruits and tomato; see Section 3).\nAdequate information to address the uniform principles criterion of the strain not being expected to persist and multiply in surface water in concentrations considerably higher than the natural background levels, provided that repeated applications over the years were not available (relevant for all representative uses evaluated; see Section 4).\nFurther data to address the potential effects to honeybee larvae and the infectivity and pathogenicity to bees and non‐target arthropods (relevant for representative field and walk‐in tunnel uses; see Section 5).\nFurther data to address the potential toxicity, infectivity and pathogenicity to earthworms and potential adverse effects to soil microorganisms (relevant for representative field and walk‐in tunnel uses; see Section 5).\nFurther hazard characterisation and assessment of the risk to terrestrial‐ and aquatic non‐target organisms from toxins/secondary metabolites such as crystal proteins present after the application of the product (relevant for representative field and walk‐in tunnel uses; see Section 5).\nFurther assessment of the risk to non‐target aquatic organisms from toxins/secondary metabolites such as crystal proteins exposure in surface water (relevant for the representative use in permanent greenhouse; see Section 5).\n\n\n\nUse of respiratory protective equipment is recommended for workers and operators in order to avoid potential adverse effects following exposure by inhalation (see Section 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAF\n\nassessment factor\n\n\n\n\nAFLP\n\namplified fragment length polymorphism\n\n\n\n\nCFU\n\ncolony‐forming units\n\n\n\n\nCI\n\nconfidence interval\n\n\n\n\nDT50\n\nperiod required for 50% dissipation (define method of estimation)\n\n\n\n\nELISA\n\nenzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay\n\n\n\n\nFOCUS\n\nForum for the Co‐ordination of Pesticide Fate Models and their Use\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nHR\n\nhazard rate\n\n\n\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organization for Standardization\n\n\n\n\nIU\n\ninternational unit\n\n\n\n\niv\n\nintravenous\n\n\n\n\nKdoc\n\norganic carbon linear adsorption coefficient\n\n\n\n\nLOQ\n\nlimit of quantification\n\n\n\n\nM/L\n\nmixing and loading\n\n\n\n\nmm\n\nmillimetre (also used for mean measured concentrations)\n\n\n\n\nMPCA\n\nmicrobial pest control agent\n\n\n\n\nMPCP\n\nmicrobial pest control product\n\n\n\n\nMRL\n\nmaximum residue level\n\n\n\n\nNRRL\n\nNorthern Regional Research Laboratory\n\n\n\n\nOECD\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development\n\n\n\n\nPEC\n\npredicted environmental concentration\n\n\n\n\nPHI\n\npreharvest interval\n\n\n\n\nRAR\n\nRenewal Assessment Report\n\n\n\n\nRBC\n\nred blood cells\n\n\n\n\nREACH\n\nRegistration, Evaluation, Authorisation of Chemicals Regulation\n\n\n\n\nSC\n\nsuspension concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSNP\n\nsingle‐nucleotide polymorphism\n\n\n\n\nUV\n\nultraviolet\n\n\n\n\nW/S\n\nwater/sediment\n\n\n\n\nw/v\n\nweight per unit volume\n\n\n\n\nw/w\n\nweight per unit weight\n\n\n\n\nWBC\n\nwhite blood cell\n\n\n\n\nWG\n\nwater‐dispersible granule\n\n\n\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n"

        "summary": "According to Article 12 of Regulation ( ) No 396/2005,   has reviewed the maximum residue levels ( s) currently established at European level for the pesticide active substance oxyfluorfen. To assess the occurrence of oxyfluorfen residues in plants, processed commodities, rotational crops and livestock,   considered the conclusions derived in the framework of Commission Regulation ( ) No 33/2008, as well as the European authorisations reported by Member States (including the supporting residues data). Based on the assessment of the available data,   proposals were derived and a consumer risk assessment was carried out. Although no apparent risk to consumers was identified, some information required by the regulatory framework was missing. Hence, the consumer risk assessment is considered indicative only and one existing European   still requires further consideration by risk managers.",
        "full-text": "Oxyfluorfen was approved on 1 January 2012 by means of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 798/2011 in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as amended by Commission Implementing Regulations (EU) No 540/2011 and 541/2011.As the active substance was approved after the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 on 2 September 2008, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to provide a reasoned opinion on the review of the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for that active substance in compliance with Article 12(1) of the aforementioned regulation.As the basis for the MRL review, on 14 August 2019, EFSA initiated the collection of data for this active substance. In a first step, Member States were invited to submit by 13 September 2019 their national Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) in a standardised way, in the format of specific GAP forms, allowing the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS), Spain, to identify the critical GAPs in the format of a specific GAP overview file. Subsequently, Member States were requested to provide residue data supporting the critical GAPs, within a period of 1 month, by 23 December 2019. On the basis of all the data submitted by Member States and by the EU Reference Laboratories for Pesticides Residues (EURLs), EFSA asked the RMS to complete the Pesticide Residues Overview File (PROFile) and to prepare a supporting evaluation report. The PROFile and evaluation report, together with Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) calculations were provided by the RMS to EFSA on 27 March 2020. Subsequently, EFSA performed the completeness check of these documents with the RMS. The outcome of this exercise including the clarifications provided by the RMS, if any, was compiled in the completeness check report. Along with the clarifications, the RMS provided an updated GAP overview file.Based on the information provided by the RMS, Member States and the EURLs, and taking into account the conclusions derived by EFSA in the framework of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008, EFSA prepared in July 2020 a draft reasoned opinion, which was circulated to Member States and EURLs for consultation via a written procedure. Comments received by 4 August 2020 were considered during the finalisation of this reasoned opinion. The following conclusions are derived.The metabolism of oxyfluorfen in plant was investigated in primary and rotational crops. According to the results of the metabolism studies, the residue definition for enforcement and risk assessment can be proposed as oxyfluorfen. A specific residue definition for rotational crops is not deemed necessary considering the very limited uptake of oxyfluorfen from the soil. Processing is not expected to impact the metabolism of oxyfluorfen; nevertheless, processing factors were derived for olive for oil production.Fully validated analytical methods are available for the enforcement of the proposed residue definition in all plant matrices at the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.01 mg/kg. According to the EURLs, the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg is achievable by using the QuEChERS method in routine analyses.Available residue trials data were considered sufficient to derive MRL proposals as well as risk assessment values for all commodities under evaluation, except for globe artichoke where no data were available to derive an MRL.Even though oxyfluorfen is persistent in the soil, it was concluded that oxyfluorfen residues did not accumulate in rotational crops provided that oxyfluorfen is applied in compliance with the uses currently authorised.Oxyfluorfen is authorised for use on crops that might be fed to livestock. Livestock dietary burden calculations were therefore performed for different groups of livestock according to OECD guidance. Since the calculated dietary burdens for all groups of livestock were found to be below the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg DM, further investigation of residues as well as the setting of MRLs in commodities of animal origin is unnecessary. Nevertheless, metabolism studies performed in lactating goats and laying hens were available; however, they were not considered appropriate to propose a residue definition.An analytical method for the determination of oxyfluorfen at the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg in all animal matrices is available. According to the EURLs, the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg is achievable in milk, egg, muscle and liver, by using the QuEChERS method in routine analyses.Chronic and acute consumer exposure resulting from the authorised uses reported in the framework of this review was calculated using revision 3.1 of the EFSA PRIMo. For globe artichoke where data were insufficient to derive an MRL, EFSA considered the existing EU MRL for an indicative calculation. The highest chronic exposure represented 7% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for the diets DE child and NL toddler; the highest acute exposure amounted to 0.5% of the acute reference dose (ARfD) for pears. Although uncertainties remain due to the data gap identified, the indicative exposure calculation did not indicate a risk to consumer's health.Regulation (EC) No 396/20051 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Regulation’) establishes the rules governing the setting and the review of pesticide maximum residue levels (MRLs) at European level. Article 12(1) of that Regulation stipulates that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) shall provide within 12 months from the date of the inclusion or non‐inclusion of an active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC2 a reasoned opinion on the review of the existing MRLs for that active substance.As oxyfluorfen was approved on 1 January 2012 by means of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 798/20113 in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107/20094 as amended by Commission Implementing Regulations (EU) No 540/20115 and 541/20116, EFSA initiated the review of all existing MRLs for that active substance.By way of background information, in the framework of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/20087, oxyfluorfen was evaluated by Spain, designated as rapporteur Member State (RMS). Subsequently, a peer review on the initial evaluation of the RMS was conducted by EFSA, leading to the conclusions as set out in the EFSA scientific output (EFSA, 2010). Furthermore, according to the provisions of the approval regulation, confirmatory information was requested, among others, as regards to confirmatory data relevant for environmental fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology sections by 31 December 2013. The confirmatory data submitted were assessed (EFSA, 2014) and the European Commission requested EFSA to deliver its conclusion in view of new data (EFSA, 2015). Subsequently, specific provisions were implemented under Regulation (EU) No 2017/3598 to further restrict the application rate of this active substance.According to the legal provisions, EFSA shall base its reasoned opinion in particular on the relevant assessment report prepared under Directive 91/414/EEC repealed by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. It should be noted, however, that, in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, only a few representative uses are evaluated, whereas MRLs set out in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 should accommodate all uses authorised within the European Union (EU), and uses authorised in third countries that have a significant impact on international trade. The information included in the assessment report prepared under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 is therefore insufficient for the assessment of all existing MRLs for a given active substance.To gain an overview of the pesticide residues data that have been considered for the setting of the existing MRLs, EFSA developed the Pesticide Residues Overview File (PROFile). The PROFile is an inventory of all pesticide residues data relevant to the risk assessment and MRL setting for a given active substance. This includes data on:\n\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in primary crops;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in processed commodities;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in rotational crops;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in livestock commodities;\nthe analytical methods for enforcement of the proposed MRLs.\nAs the basis for the MRL review, on 14 August 2019, EFSA initiated the collection of data for this active substance. In a first step, Member States were invited to submit by 13 September 2019 their Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) that are authorised nationally, in a standardised way, in the format of specific GAP forms. In the framework of this consultation, 16 Member States provided feedback on their national authorisations of oxyfluorfen. Based on the GAP data submitted, the designated RMS, Spain, was asked to identify the critical GAPs to be further considered in the assessment, in the format of a specific GAP overview file. Subsequently, in a second step, Member States were requested to provide residue data supporting the critical GAPs by 23 December 2019.On the basis of all the data submitted by Member States and the EU Reference Laboratories for Pesticides Residues (EURLs), EFSA asked Spain to complete the PROFile and to prepare a supporting evaluation report. The PROFile and the supporting evaluation report, together with the Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) calculations, were submitted to EFSA on 27 March 2020. Subsequently, EFSA performed the completeness check of these documents with the RMS. The outcome of this exercise including the clarifications provided by the RMS, if any, was compiled in the completeness check report. Along with the clarifications, the RMS provided an updated GAP overview file.Considering all the available information, EFSA prepared in July 2020 a draft reasoned opinion, which was circulated to Member States and EURLs for commenting via a written procedure. All comments received by 4 August 2020 were considered by EFSA during the finalisation of the reasoned opinion.The evaluation report submitted by the RMS (Spain, 2019), taking into account also the information provided by Member States during the collection of data, and the EURLs report on analytical methods (EURLs, 2019) are considered as main supporting documents to this reasoned opinion and, thus, made publicly available.In addition, further supporting documents to this reasoned opinion are the completeness check report (EFSA, 2020a) and the Member States consultation report (EFSA, 2020b). These reports are developed to address all issues raised in the course of the review, from the initial completeness check to the reasoned opinion. Furthermore, the exposure calculations for all crops reported in the framework of this review performed using the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) and the PROFile as well as the GAP overview file listing all authorised uses are key supporting documents and made publicly available as background documents to this reasoned opinion. A screenshot of the report sheet of the PRIMo is presented in Appendix C.According to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, EFSA shall provide a reasoned opinion on:\n\nthe inclusion of the active substance in Annex IV to the Regulation, when appropriate;\nthe necessity of setting new MRLs for the active substance or deleting/modifying existing MRLs set out in Annex II or III of the Regulation;\nthe inclusion of the recommended MRLs in Annex II or III to the Regulation;\nthe setting of specific processing factors as referred to in Article 20(2) of the Regulation.\nOxyfluorfen is the ISO common name for 2‐chloro‐4‐(trifluoromethyl)phenyl 3‐ethoxy‐4‐nitrophenyl ether (IUPAC). The chemical structure of the active substance and its main metabolite is reported in Appendix F.The approval of oxyfluorfen is restricted to uses as herbicide for banded applications close to ground from autumn to early spring, at a rate not exceeding 150 g a.s./ha per year (Regulation (EU) No 2017/359).The EU MRLs for oxyfluorfen are established in Annexes IIIA of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. Codex maximum residue limits (CXLs) for oxyfluorfen are not available. There are no MRL changes occurred since the entry into force of the Regulation mentioned above.For the purpose of this MRL review, all the uses of oxyfluorfen currently authorised within the EU as submitted by the Member States during the GAP collection, have been reported by the RMS in the GAP overview file. The critical GAPs identified in the GAP overview file were then summarised in the PROFile and considered in the assessment. The details of the authorised critical GAPs for oxyfluorfen are given in Appendix A. The RMS did not report any use authorised in third countries that might have a significant impact on international trade.EFSA has based its assessment on the following documents:\n\nthe PROFile submitted by the RMS;\nthe evaluation report accompanying the PROFile (Spain, 2019);\nthe draft assessment report (DAR) prepared under Council Directive 91/414/EEC (Spain, 2006);\nthe final addendum of the additional report (AR) prepared under Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 (Spain, 2010);\nthe conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance oxyfluorfen (EFSA, 2010);\nthe updated review report on oxyfluorfen, following the submission and evaluation of confirmatory data submitted post‐approval of the substance (European Commission, 2017a).\nThe assessment is performed in accordance with the legal provisions of the uniform principles for evaluation and authorisation of plant protection products as set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/20119 and the currently applicable guidance documents relevant for the consumer risk assessment of pesticide residues (European Commission, 1997a, b, c d, e, f, g, 2000, 2010a, b, 2017b; OECD, 2008, 2011, 2013).More detailed information on the available data and on the conclusions derived by EFSA can be retrieved from the list of end points reported in Appendix B.Oxyfluorfen is authorised for use on crops (head cabbage, sunflower, apple, citrus) that might be fed to livestock. Livestock dietary burden calculations were therefore performed for different groups of livestock according to OECD guidance (OECD, 2013), which has now also been agreed upon at European level. The input values for all relevant commodities are summarised in Appendix D.Since the calculated dietary burdens for all groups of livestock were found to be below the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg dry matter (DM), further investigation of residues as well as the setting of MRLs in commodities of animal origin is unnecessary.Although not required, the metabolism of oxyfluorfen residues in livestock was investigated in lactating goats and laying hens at dose rates covering the maximum dietary burdens calculated in this review (Spain, 2019). Feeding studies were also available. These studies were assessed in the framework of the peer review (Spain, 2006; EFSA, 2010).The metabolism studies conducted with 14C‐CPR or 14C‐NPR radiolabelled oxyfluorfen showed that residues in animal matrices were mainly composed of the parent and metabolites structurally related to the parent. However, these studies were not considered appropriate since they were conducted with oxyfluorfen, whereas the plant metabolism data have shown that parent oxyfluorfen is not present in plant commodities following application of this active substance (EFSA, 2010). Nevertheless, additional data are not required as no residue definitions and no MRLs are needed for animal matrices.An analytical method using GC‐ECD was fully validated for the determination of oxyfluorfen at the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg in all animal matrices (EFSA, 2010).According to the EURLs, the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg is achievable in infant formula (milk), muscle, egg and liver by using the QuEChERS method in routine analyses. Even lower levels were successfully validated down to 0.001 mg/kg in egg and muscle, down to 0.002 mg/kg in liver and down to 0.0025 mg/kg in infant formula (milk) (EURLs, 2019).Storage stability of oxyfluorfen was investigated and demonstrated oxyfluorfen to be stable at –10°C for a period of 14 months in muscle and liver, and of 12 months in milk and eggs (Spain, 2006; EFSA, 2010).Chronic and acute exposure calculations for all crops reported in the framework of this review were performed using revision 3.1 of the EFSA PRIMo (EFSA, 2018, 2019). Input values for the exposure calculations were derived in compliance with the decision tree reported in Appendix E. Hence, for those commodities where an MRL could be derived by EFSA in the framework of this review, input values were derived according to the internationally agreed methodologies (FAO, 2009). For globe artichoke where data were insufficient to derive an MRL in Section 1, EFSA considered the existing EU MRL for an indicative calculation. All input values included in the exposure calculations are summarised in Appendix D.The exposure values calculated were compared with the toxicological reference values for oxyfluorfen, derived by EFSA (2010). The highest chronic exposure was calculated for DE child and NL toddler, representing 7% of the ADI, and the highest acute exposure was calculated for pears, representing 0.5% of the acute reference dose (ARfD). Although uncertainties remain due to the data gap identified in the previous sections, this indicative exposure calculation did not indicate a risk to consumer's health.The metabolism of oxyfluorfen in plant was investigated in primary and rotational crops. According to the results of the metabolism studies, the residue definition for enforcement and risk assessment can be proposed as oxyfluorfen. A specific residue definition for rotational crops is not deemed necessary considering the very limited uptake of oxyfluorfen from the soil. Processing is not expected to impact the metabolism of oxyfluorfen, nevertheless processing factors were derived for olive for oil production.Fully validated analytical methods are available for the enforcement of the proposed residue definition in all plant matrices at the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg. According to the EURLs, the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg is achievable by using the QuEChERS method in routine analyses.Available residue trials data were considered sufficient to derive MRL proposals as well as risk assessment values for all commodities under evaluation, except for globe artichoke where no data were available to derive an MRL.Even though oxyfluorfen is persistent in the soil, it was concluded that oxyfluorfen residues did not accumulate in rotational crops provided that oxyfluorfen is applied in compliance with the uses currently authorised.Oxyfluorfen is authorised for use on crops that might be fed to livestock. Livestock dietary burden calculations were therefore performed for different groups of livestock according to OECD guidance. Since the calculated dietary burdens for all groups of livestock were found to be below the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg DM, further investigation of residues as well as the setting of MRLs in commodities of animal origin is unnecessary. Nevertheless, metabolism studies performed in lactating goats and laying hens were available; however, they were not considered appropriate to propose a residue definition.An analytical method for the determination of oxyfluorfen at the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg in all animal matrices is available. According to the EURLs, the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg is achievable in milk, egg, muscle and liver, by using the QuEChERS method in routine analyses.Chronic and acute consumer exposure resulting from the authorised uses reported in the framework of this review was calculated using revision 3.1 of the EFSA PRIMo. For globe artichoke where data were insufficient to derive an MRL, EFSA considered the existing EU MRL for an indicative calculation. The highest chronic exposure represented 7% of the ADI for the diets DE child and NL toddler; the highest acute exposure amounted to 0.5% of the ARfD for pears. Although uncertainties remain due to the data gap identified, the indicative exposure calculation did not indicate a risk to consumer's health.MRL recommendations were derived in compliance with the decision tree reported in Appendix E of the reasoned opinion (see Table 1). All MRL values listed as ‘Recommended’ in the table are sufficiently supported by data and are therefore proposed for inclusion in Annex II to the Regulation. The remaining MRL values listed in the table are not recommended for inclusion in Annex II because they require further consideration by risk managers (see Table 1 footnotes for details). In particular, one existing EU MRL needs to be confirmed by the following data:\n\nfour residue trials supporting the southern outdoor GAP on globe artichokes.\nIf the above reported data gap is not addressed in the future, Member States are recommended to withdraw or modify the relevant authorisations at national level.\n\n\n\na.s. \nactive substance\n\n\n\nADI\n\nacceptable daily intake\n\n\n\n\nAR\n\napplied radioactivity\n\n\n\n\nARfD\n\nacute reference dose\n\n\n\n\nBBCH\n\ngrowth stages of mono‐ and dicotyledonous plants\n\n\n\n\nbw\n\nbody weight\n\n\n\n\nCAS\n\nChemical Abstract Service\n\n\n\n\nCF\n\nconversion factor for enforcement residue definition to risk assessment residue definition\n\n\n\n\nCV\n\ncoefficient of variation (relative standard deviation)\n\n\n\n\nCXL\n\ncodex maximum residue limit\n\n\n\n\nDAR\n\ndraft assessment report\n\n\n\n\nDAT\n\ndays after treatment\n\n\n\n\nDB\n\ndietary burden\n\n\n\n\nDM\n\ndry matter\n\n\n\n\nDP\n\ndustable powder\n\n\n\n\nDS\n\npowder for dry seed treatment\n\n\n\n\nDT90\n\nperiod required for 90% dissipation (define method of estimation)\n\n\n\n\nEC\n\nemulsifiable concentrate\n\n\n\n\nECD\n\nelectron capture detector\n\n\n\n\nEDI\n\nestimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nEMS\n\nevaluating Member State\n\n\n\n\neq\n\nresidue expressed as a.s. equivalent\n\n\n\n\nEURLs\n\nEuropean Union Reference Laboratories for Pesticide Residues (former CRLs)\n\n\n\n\nFAO\n\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nGC\n\ngas chromatography\n\n\n\n\nGC‐ECD\n\ngas chromatography with electron capture detector\n\n\n\n\nGC‐MS\n\ngas chromatography with mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nGC‐MS/MS\n\ngas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nGS\n\ngrowth stage\n\n\n\n\nHR\n\nhighest residue\n\n\n\n\nIEDI\n\ninternational estimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nIESTI\n\ninternational estimated short‐term intake\n\n\n\n\nILV\n\nindependent laboratory validation\n\n\n\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organisation for Standardization\n\n\n\n\nIUPAC\n\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n\n\n\n\nLC\n\nliquid chromatography\n\n\n\n\nLC‐MS/MS\n\nliquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nLOQ\n\nlimit of quantification\n\n\n\n\nMo\n\nMonitoring\n\n\n\n\nMRL\n\nmaximum residue level\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nMember States\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nmass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nMS/MS\n\ntandem mass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nMW\n\nmolecular weight\n\n\n\n\nNEDI\n\nnational estimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nNESTI\n\nnational estimated short‐term intake\n\n\n\nNTMDI \nnational theoretical maximum daily intake\n\n\n\nOECD\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development\n\n\n\n\nPBI\n\nplant back interval\n\n\n\n\nPF\n\nprocessing factor\n\n\n\n\nPHI\n\npre‐harvest interval\n\n\n\n\nPow\n\npartition coefficient between n‐octanol and water\n\n\n\n\nppm\n\nparts per million (10−6)\n\n\n\n\nPRIMo\n\n(EFSA) Pesticide Residues Intake Model\n\n\n\n\nPROFile\n\n(EFSA) Pesticide Residues Overview File\n\n\n\n\nQuEChERS\n\nQuick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (analytical method)\n\n\n\n\nRA\n\nrisk assessment\n\n\n\n\nRD\n\nresidue definition\n\n\n\n\nRAC\n\nraw agricultural commodity\n\n\n\n\nRD\n\nresidue definition\n\n\n\n\nRMS\n\nrapporteur Member State\n\n\n\n\nSANCO\n\nDirectorate‐General for Health and Consumers\n\n\n\n\nSC\n\nsuspension concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSEU\n\nsouthern European Union\n\n\n\n\nSMILES\n\nsimplified molecular‐input line‐entry system\n\n\n\n\nSTMR\n\nsupervised trials median residue\n\n\n\n\nTAR\n\ntotal applied radioactivity\n\n\n\n\nTMDI\n\ntheoretical maximum daily intake\n\n\n\n\nTRR\n\ntotal radioactive residue\n\n\n\n\nUV\n\nultraviolet (detector)\n\n\n\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n"

The context of the peer review was that required by Commission Implementing Regulation ( ) No 844/2012, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation ( ) No 2018/1659. The conclusions were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of     5/F52 as an insecticide and acaricide on meadows, grassland, amenity turf, maize, wine and table grape, potato, allium vegetables (only field uses) and ornamentals (floriculture, tree nurseries and perennials), strawberry, currants and berries, solanaceae fruiting vegetables (field and greenhouse uses) and cucurbit fruiting vegetables (only greenhouse uses).

Concerns are identified.",
        "full-text": "Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/1659, lays down the procedure for the renewal of the approval of active substances submitted under Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. The list of those substances is established in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 686/2012. Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 is one of the active substances listed in Regulation (EU) No 686/2012.In accordance with Article 1 of Regulation (EU) No 844/2012, the rapporteur Member State (RMS), the Netherlands, and co‐rapporteur Member State (co‐RMS), France, received an application from Agrifutur s.r.l and Novozymes France S.A.S for the renewal of approval of the active substance Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52.An initial evaluation of the dossier on Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 was provided by the RMS in the renewal assessment report (RAR), and subsequently, a peer review of the pesticide risk assessment on the RMS evaluation was conducted by EFSA in accordance with Article 13 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/1659. The following conclusions are derived.The uses of Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 according to the representative uses as an insecticide and acaricide on meadows, grassland, amenity turf, maize, wine and table grape, potato, allium vegetables (only field uses) and ornamentals (floriculture, tree nurseries and perennials), strawberry, currants and berries, solanaceae fruiting vegetables (field and greenhouse uses) and cucurbit fruiting vegetables (only greenhouse uses), as proposed at EU level result in a sufficient insecticidal and acaricidal efficacy against the target organisms.The assessment of the data package revealed no issues that need to be included as critical areas of concern with respect to the identity of the active substance, physical and technical properties of the representative formulations.In the area of mammalian toxicology, the production of toxins/secondary metabolites was not excluded in the technical grade of the microbial (BIPESCO 5), the end use product (GranMet GR) and after application (for both applicants). Therefore, further information is needed to conclude on the risk assessment for operators and bystander (for BIPESCO 5/GranMet GR) and for workers and residents (for both applicants) (issue not finalised).In the area of residues, data gaps were identified and the consumer risk assessment cannot be finalised for the edible uses, specifically for protected uses and uses in the root crop category, and with regard to livestock grazing on treated grassland, until the outstanding issues on metabolites are addressed and it is confirmed by the toxicological assessment that a quantitative consumer risk assessment with regard to metabolites is not necessary.The information available was sufficient to conclude on the environmental exposure in soil and natural water systems for the organism. The groundwater exposure assessment could not be finalised for the toxins/secondary metabolites destruxins and swainsonine for the representative uses of the product containing the strain identifier of BIPESCO 5 (which is relevant for the field uses on grassland, maize and grapevines and uses in protected cropping systems on strawberry and ornamentals).The risk assessment and the toxicity, infectiveness and pathogenicity to honeybees could not be finalised (relevant for all the representative field and walk‐in tunnel uses evaluated).The risk assessment could not be finalised for soil microorganisms (relevant for all representative uses evaluated).Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/20121, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/16592 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Regulation’), lays down the provisions for the procedure of the renewal of the approval of active substances, submitted under Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/20093. This regulates for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) the procedure for organising the consultation of Member States, the applicant(s) and the public on the initial evaluation provided by the rapporteur Member State (RMS) and/or co‐rapporteur Member State (co‐RMS) in the renewal assessment report (RAR), and the organisation of an expert consultation where appropriate.In accordance with Article 13 of the Regulation, unless formally informed by the European Commission that a conclusion is not necessary, EFSA is required to adopt a conclusion on whether the active substance can be expected to meet the approval criteria provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 within 5 months from the end of the period provided for the submission of written comments, subject to an extension of an additional 3 months where additional information is required to be submitted by the applicant(s) in accordance with Article 13(3).In accordance with Article 1 of the Regulation, the RMS, the Netherlands and co‐RMS, France, received an application from Agrifutur s.r.l and Novozymes France S.A.S for the renewal of approval of the active substance Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52. Complying with Article 8 of the Regulation, the RMS checked the completeness of the dossier and informed the applicants, the co‐RMS (France), the European Commission and EFSA about the admissibility.The RMS provided its initial evaluation of the dossier on Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 in the RAR, which was received by EFSA on 3 June 2019 (The Netherlands, 2019).In accordance with Article 12 of the Regulation, EFSA distributed the RAR to the Member States and the applicants, Agrifutur s.r.l and Novozymes France S.A.S, for consultation and comments on 8 August 2019. EFSA also provided comments. In addition, EFSA conducted a public consultation on the RAR. EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the European Commission on 8 October 2019. At the same time, the collated comments were forwarded to the RMS for compilation and evaluation in the format of a reporting table. The applicants were invited to respond to the comments in column 3 of the reporting table. The comments and the applicants’ response were evaluated by the RMS in column 3.The need for expert consultation and the necessity for additional information to be submitted by the applicants in accordance with Article 13(3) of the Regulation were considered in a telephone conference between EFSA and the RMS on 17 January 2020. On the basis of the comments received, the applicants’ response to the comments and the RMS's evaluation thereof, it was concluded that additional information should be requested from the applicants, and that EFSA should conduct an expert consultation in the area of effects on non‐target organisms.The outcome of the telephone conference, together with EFSA's further consideration of the comments, is reflected in the conclusions set out in column 4 of the reporting table. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase and which required further consideration, including those issues to be considered in an expert consultation, were compiled by EFSA in the format of an evaluation table.The conclusions arising from the consideration by EFSA, and as appropriate by the RMS, of the points identified in the evaluation table, together with the outcome of the expert consultation and the written consultation on the assessment of additional information, where these took place, were reported in the final column of the evaluation table.A final consultation on the conclusions arising from the peer review of the risk assessment took place with Member States via a written procedure in August–September 2020.This conclusion report summarises the outcome of the peer review of the risk assessment of the active substance and the representative formulation, evaluated on the basis of the representative uses of Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 as an insecticide and acaricide on meadows, grassland, amenity turf, maize, wine and table grape, potato, allium vegetables (only field uses) and ornamentals (floriculture, tree nurseries and perennials), strawberry, currants and berries, solanaceae fruiting vegetables (field and greenhouse uses) and cucurbit fruiting vegetables (only greenhouse uses), as proposed by the applicants. In accordance with Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, risk mitigation options identified in the RAR and considered during the peer review are presented in the conclusion. A list of the relevant end points for the active substance and the formulation is provided in Appendix A.In addition, a key supporting document to this conclusion is the peer review report (EFSA, 2020), which is a compilation of the documentation developed to evaluate and address all issues raised in the peer review, from the initial commenting phase to the conclusion. The peer review report comprises the following documents, in which all views expressed during the course of the peer review, including minority views, where applicable, can be found:\n\nthe comments received on the RAR;\nthe reporting table (20 January 2020);\nthe evaluation table (22 September 2020);\nthe report(s) of the scientific consultation with Member State experts (where relevant);\nthe comments received on the assessment of the additional information (where relevant);\nthe comments received on the draft EFSA conclusion.\nGiven the importance of the RAR, including its revisions (The Netherlands, 2020), and the peer review report, both documents are considered as background documents to this conclusion and thus are made publicly available.It is recommended that this conclusion report and its background documents would not be accepted to support any registration outside the EU for which the applicant has not demonstrated that it has regulatory access to the information on which this conclusion report is based.Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 is a fungus deposited at the following culture collections with the respective accession numbers: BBA, Germany: M.a. 43 (acronyms Z43); BIPESCO project, EU: BIPESCO 5; CBS number 123710 (BIPESCO 5); DSM number 21978 (BIPESCO 5); Novozymes, Earth BioScience, F52 (F‐52); HRI, UK: 275‐86 (acronyms V275 or KVL275 or HRI 27586); KVL Denmark: KVL 99‐112 (Ma 275 or V 275); Bayer, Germany: DSM 3884; BIO1020; ATCC, USA: ATCC 90448; USDA, Ithaca, USA: ARSEF 1095. Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 is a naturally occurring strain, originally isolated from a codling moth in Austria.The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ‘GranMet GR’ and ‘Met52 granular/Bio 1020′, both granule formulations (GR) and ‘Met52 OD/Bio 1020 OD’ an oil dispersion (OD), containing 30 g/kg (min. 7.24 × 1010 colony‐forming units (CFU)/kg, max. 9.91 × 1010 CFU/kg), 20 g/kg (min. 9 × 1011 CFU/kg, max. 3 × 1012 CFU/kg) and 110 g/kg (min. 2 × 1012 CFU/L, max. 9 × 1012 CFU/L) Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52, respectively. FAO specifications do not exist for these products.The representative uses evaluated comprise professional and non‐professional field, permanent greenhouse and walk‐in tunnel uses as an insecticide and acaricide in agriculture, horticulture, viticulture and forestry. The representative uses of ‘GranMet GR’ were applications by overall drilling in meadows and other grassland against Japanese beetle, white grubs, garden chafer, summer chafer, European chafer, in maize against western corn rootworm, in wine grape and table grape against Daktulosphaira vitifoliae and applications by incorporation in soil in protected floriculture, tree nurseries and perennials against Japanese beetle and in protected strawberry against Otiorhynchus sp., in the EU. The representative uses of ‘MET52 granular/Bio 1020’ were applications by soil incorporation in field and protected strawberry, currants and berries, floriculture and ornamentals, tree nursery crops and perennials against black vine weevil and in field potato against wireworm. The representative uses of ‘MET52 OD’ were applications by foliar spraying on protected strawberry against thrips and mites, on fruiting vegetables, against thrips, mites and whiteflies, on ornamentals, tree nursery and perennials against white flies and field applications on grape, solanaceae and allium vegetables against thrips, in the EU. Full details of the good agricultural practices (GAPs) can be found in the list of end points in Appendix A.Data were submitted to conclude that the uses of Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 according to the representative uses proposed at EU level result in a sufficient insecticidal and acaricidal efficacy against the targeted organisms, following the guidance document SANCO/2012/11251‐rev. 4 (European Commission, 2014).A data gap has been identified for a search of the scientific peer‐reviewed open literature on the active substance and its relevant metabolites, dealing with side effects on health and non‐target species and published within the 10 years before the date of submission of the dossier, to be conducted and reported in accordance with EFSA guidance on the submission of scientific peer‐reviewed open literature for the approval of pesticide active substances under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 (EFSA, 2011). In addition, a data gap has been identified on a transparent evaluation of the reliability of 54 articles on swainsonine and an open question remains whether swainsonine is produced by the strain or not (EFSA, 2020).The following guidance documents were followed in the production of this conclusion: SANCO/12116/2012–rev. 0 (European Commission, 2012).It should be noted that both F52 and BIPESCO 5 are subcultures from the isolate Ma43 formerly identified as Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae strain BIPESCO 5/F52 and reclassified as Metarhizium brunneum. BIPESCO 5 and F52 are considered the same strain in terms of biological and genetic properties and there are not known differences between BIPESCO 5/F52 and the original isolate Ma43 based on sequencing analysis.The technical grade microbial pest control agent (MPCA) is only a hypothetical stage in the continuous production process of the end use product (MPCP) GranMet GR containing BIPESCO 5. As a consequence, the specification is given for the formulated product of strain BIPESCO 5 of minimum content of 7.24 × 1010 CFU/kg (max. content: 9.91 × 1010 CFU/kg). Novozymes on the other hand presented 5‐batch data for the technical grade, indicating that for F52, MPCA and MPCP are separate entities. The proposed specification for the technical grade of Metarhizium brunneum strain F52 MCPA is 996 g spores/kg with minimum 9 × 1012 CFU/kg (max. 6 × 1013 CFU/kg); however, a data gap was identified for good laboratory practice (GLP) compliant MCPA 5‐batch data for strain F52.Identification of Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 can be done by Elongation Factor 1α (EF1α) sequence analysis and subsequent comparison with sequences of reference strains and simple sequence repeat (SSR, microsatellite) marker analysis to discriminate genotypes within individual Metarhizium species.The main metabolites produced by Metarhizium brunneum are destruxin A, B, D and E, cytochalasin C, D and E and swainsonine. Swainsonine was considered to be toxicologically relevant (see Section 2). The production of these metabolites is dependent on the strain, specific environment and nutritional conditions. Destruxins, cytochalasins and swainsonine were reported as not having been detected in the MPCA and MPCP. A data gap was, however, identified for the submission of an amended study report confirming the details on how the determination of metabolites was completed for strain BIPESCO 5/GranMet GR.There is no evidence of direct relationships of Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 to known plant, animal or human pathogens. The analysis of contaminating microorganisms in commercially produced batches complies with the requirements of SANCO/12116/2012 rev.0 (European Commission, 2012).The optimum temperature of growth of Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 ranged from 27°C to 30°C. Growth was limited at 34°C and no growth was observed at 37°C. Metarhizium brunneum is sensitive to UV light.Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 was sensitive to itraconazole, voriconazole, caspofungin, posaconazole and micafungin and no inhibition was observed for amphotericin‐B and anidulafungin.The assessment of the data package revealed no issues that need to be included as critical areas of concern with respect to the identity of the active substance, physical and technical properties of the representative formulations; however, data gaps were identified for the determination of shelf‐life of the formulation GranMet GR. A data gap was also identified for aerobic plate count data on additional QC‐batches (Novozymes products, pre‐storage only) to show that microbial contamination of batches is under control.Acceptable methods are available for the determination of the microorganism content in the formulation and for the determination of the content of contaminating microorganisms.No residue definition was applicable for Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52; therefore, no post‐registration monitoring methods are needed.Metarhizium brunneum (previously Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae) BIPESCO 5/F52 was discussed at the Pesticide Peer Review Meeting Teleconference 17 in June 2020.\nGeneral data\nFew clinical cases of human infection by Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae (strain not mentioned) were described in the open literature. From these reports, it can be concluded that infection with the fungus Metarhizium brunneum is rare for immunocompromised humans and associated with risk factors such as eye trauma, injuries and use of contaminated lenses. In none of the studies was reported how the exposure took place. Furthermore, it has been shown that growth of Metarhizium brunneum occurs between 25°C and 30°C, and as a consequence, human infection can be considered unlikely.No signs of sensitisation effect or allergic reaction have been observed for BIPESCO 5, whereas some reports of hypersensitivity cases are available for F52 from medical surveillance data, attributed to incorrect use or lack of use of PPE.Metarhizium brunneum (previous Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae) is not recommended for the Qualified Presumption of Safety list (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2020).\nToxicity/Infectivity/Pathogenicity studies\nAs the available methods for testing dermal sensitisation are not suitable for testing microorganisms and there are no validated test methods for sensitisation by inhalation, the following warning phrase is proposed as a precautionary measure: ‘Contains Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52. Micro‐organisms may have the potential to provoke sensitising reactions’.In acute oral toxicity studies with rats, Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 showed no signs of toxicity or pathogenicity or infectivity. In an acute inhalation study with rats, slight, but reversible effects (increased weight in males and lung discolouration in females) were observed in the lungs. Increased relative spleen weight was seen on days 3 and 7 but not at day 14 after acute intraperitoneal exposure in rats. Complete clearance was observed in all acute toxicity studies. No acute dermal toxicity was observed in rabbits exposed to Metarhizium anisopliae strain F52. In an eye irritation study, this microorganism showed slight eye irritation properties.Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 as well as its crude extracts and pure secondary metabolites (commercially available and purified toxins) have shown no genotoxic activities in several Ames assays (including also two Ames MPFTM I Microplate Format assays and one public Literature Ames study) as well as Vitotox Tests; these were considered as supportive information.Taking the studies on acute toxicity into account the microorganism Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 can be considered as a substance of low acute toxicity. Consequently, no adverse effects are expected after repeated exposure to Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 and no further studies were considered to be necessary.\nSecondary metabolites/toxins\nThe main metabolites produced by Metarhizium brunneum are destruxin A, B, D and E, cytochalasin C, D and E and swainsonine. Other metabolites were also identified in the literature review (see data gap for literature review). With data from the available literature, showing negative results in supportive genotoxicity/cytotoxicity tests, no concern was raised; however, the full toxicological profile of destruxins and cytochalasins cannot be determined, no toxicological information has been identified for other possible metabolites, whilst swainsonine was identified as causal agent of food poisoning in livestock (grazing on plants contaminated by other fungi closely related to Metarhizium brunneum). It was reported that the consumption of this toxin containing plants leads to nervous signs and neurological alterations, also confirmed in mice and rats studies.\nReference values and exposure\nTaking into account the absence of any toxicity, pathogenicity or infectivity, no reference values are required for Metarhizium brunneum F52/BIPESCO 5, and no operator, worker, resident and bystander exposure estimates for the microbial were considered necessary.For the toxicologically relevant metabolite swainsonine, as the exposure may also occur due to endophytic behaviour (ability to grow and colonise in plants), a concern is identified. This concern would apply for both indoor and outdoor uses considering the poisoning cases in livestock (supporting outdoor endophytic behaviour). It is noted that the RMS was of the opinion that swainsonine is only a concern for indoor uses due to UV light sensitivity and limited occurrence of endophytic behaviour in controlled conditions.Pending on further assessment of the production of the secondary metabolites in the MPCA/MPCP (for BIPESCO 5/GranMet GR) and after application (for both applicants), further toxicological assessment might be required to conclude on the risk assessment for operators (for BIPESCO 5/GranMet GR), workers (for both applicants), bystanders (for BIPESCO 5/GranMet GR) and residents (for both applicants) (issue not finalised). In the absence of a quantitative risk assessment and due to the potential for sensitisation by inhalation, the use of respiratory protective equipment (RPE) for the operators might be considered to reduce the exposure via inhalation.Studies suggest that under natural conditions, endophytism of Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 is only transient on aerial parts of plants, but colonisation was observed in samples of root tissue. These observations are coherent with the microorganism's reported UV light sensitivity and a need for high relative humidity in order to thrive. Newer publications report that Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 has the capacity to colonise leaves, stems, roots of inoculated plants (after seed treatments and spray applications) in laboratory and greenhouse experiments. In addition, use of specific formulations of Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52, such as encapsulation, enhanced the survival of the fungus upon application, enabled growth on different soils and significantly increased endophytism also in aerial plant parts when compared to plants treated with non‐formulated fungal biomass. It is concluded that under favourable conditions Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 can systematically colonise different parts of plants, and case‐by‐case consideration is recommended for the assessment of different use scenarios, including formulation types.As the microorganism itself is not infective and not pathogenic and is not related to any known pathogens, the assessment of consumer exposure to viable residues of Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 is not necessary.However, due to the endophytic lifestyle of Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52, the microorganism could produce non‐viable residues (metabolites) in plant matrices. Based on the available evidence and regarding the representative uses, specifically for applications in the greenhouse and for uses in the root crop category, endophytic behaviour and therewith production of metabolites cannot be excluded.Depending on the strain, the environment and the nutritional conditions, the species Metarhizium brunneum can produce destruxin A, B, D and E, cytochalasin C, D and E, swainsonine and possibly several other metabolites according to scientific literature. Information on metabolites produced on plants and related directly to the strain BIPESCO 5/F52 is very limited. In studies with Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 in potato, destruxin A and B were detected in potato tuber, root, stem and leave samples. The toxicological profile of destruxins cannot be fully determined (see Section 2). Indication for possible production of the relevant metabolite swainsonine by Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 is lacking qualitative and quantitative information. Any additional metabolite was not addressed by data or by an adequate scientific literature search (data gap). Therefore, a full characterisation of the metabolite profile of Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 is still needed (data gap).The consumer risk assessment cannot be finalised for the edible uses, specifically for protected uses and uses in the root crop category, until the outstanding issues on possible metabolites are addressed and it is confirmed by the toxicological assessment that a quantitative consumer risk assessment with regard to metabolites is not necessary.For the representative non‐protected crop uses, where aerial plant parts are the harvested commodities, the likelihood for occurrence of metabolites is considered low based on evidence submitted regarding the specific conditions required for Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 to colonise in plant tissues as a prerequisite to produce metabolites, however, cannot be excluded with absolute certainty.It is also noted that poisoning in grazing livestock with swainsonine arising from plants contaminated by other fungi closely related to Metarhizium brunneum was a reported case (see Section 2). Therefore, the assessment of the use in meadows and grassland cannot be finalised as for the unclear exposure potential of grazing livestock to metabolites of Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52.A consumer risk assessment is not considered relevant for uses in floriculture, ornamentals, tree nursery and non‐edible perennial crops, provided treated soil is not recycled to grow edible crops.Satisfactory information was provided in relation to potential interference of Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 with the analytical systems for the control of the quality of drinking water provided for in Directive 98/83/EC4 (see specific Annex VI decision‐making criteria in Part II Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/20115). It was concluded that Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 is unlikely to interfere with the methodologies routinely used for such determinations.Being a mitotic asexual fungus (no sexual recombination or meiosis having been observed in its life cycle), in which mobile genetic elements or retrotransposons have not been identified by the available genome sequencing of Metarhizium brunneum, Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 would not be expected to have the potential for transfer of genetic material to other organisms. The genome analysis revealed genes for several heterokaryon incompatibility proteins, which are also known to block DNA exchange.A study investigating the toxicity, infectivity and pathogenicity of Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 to birds was available and did not indicate any adverse effects. Based on the lack of infectivity and pathogenicity in the available study, a low risk to birds was concluded (relevant for all representative uses).As concluded in Section 2, sufficient information is available to finalise the assessment of infectivity and pathogenicity of Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 in mammals. A low risk of infectivity and pathogenicity to wild mammals is concluded (relevant for all representative uses).Adequate studies were available with aquatic organisms showing no toxicity, infectivity and pathogenicity to aquatic organisms from Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52. A high margin of safety was observed when comparing the end points with expected spore concentrations in the environment after entry into surface water from the representative field and walk‐in tunnel uses. Based on the lack of toxicity, infectivity and pathogenicity in the available studies, a low risk to aquatic organisms from exposure to the microorganism was concluded for all representative uses.During the Pesticide Peer Review Meeting Teleconference 17 (June 2020), the risk assessment on bees was discussed. A contact laboratory study on honeybee exposed to Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 was available. However, due to the high mortality in the control group and to not optimal conditions for the bees, the experts agreed that the study should not be considered in the assessment. In a laboratory study with honeybee larvae exposed to Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52, no statistical difference was seen between the control and the treated groups. However, infectivity or pathogenicity was not assessed in the study. The evidence suggests from a single laboratory study that this strain is infective and pathogenic to bumblebees in the highest dose tested. The available tunnel study with bumblebee exposed to the strain was not considered fully reliable due to poor weather conditions and assessment of mortality only. It was noted that exposure to bumblebees nesting in the soil is expected and it may take several years for the strain to return to background levels in soil (see Section 4.1). The experts agreed that the information on infectivity and pathogenicity was limited as it is based on a single laboratory study and that reliable higher tier data were not available. Based on the available information, risk to bumblebees was identified as infectivity and pathogenicity cannot be excluded. As there are several uncertainties and the evidence is weak, further data are needed to reach a more robust conclusion for bumblebees. Insufficient information was available on the toxicity, infectivity and pathogenicity to honeybees resulting in a data gap and a conclusion not finalised for representative field and walk‐in tunnel uses with drilling, mechanical soil incorporation of granulates and spray application. For the representative field/walk‐in tunnel uses by manual soil incorporation and uses in permanent greenhouse low risk is concluded due to negligible exposure. Risk to intentionally introduced pollinators in permanent greenhouses cannot be excluded for spray applications.During the Pesticide Peer Review Meeting Teleconference 17 (June 2020), the risk assessment on non‐target arthropods was discussed. Overall, the experts agreed that based on the available data, the infectivity and pathogenicity assessment indicates that non‐target arthropods can be infected under both laboratory and field conditions. Owing to the lack of exposure, a low risk is concluded for the representative uses in permanent greenhouses. However, exposure to non‐target arthropods cannot be excluded from representative field‐ and walk‐in tunnel uses; hence, for these uses, a high risk is concluded. The RMS does not agree with this conclusion as they propose several argumentations to suggest a low risk to non‐target arthropods. (i.e. non‐target arthropods have co‐evolved with microorganisms and have coping strategies for infection). The experts acknowledged that there is a difference in acceptability criteria for non‐target arthropod field studies performed for chemical pesticides (in‐field recovery within 1 year) and microorganism pesticides (no consideration of recovery). Nevertheless, the available data indicated that Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 is infectious and pathogenic to non‐target arthropods, and under field conditions, effects were still apparent for several months.Adequate data were available that indicated that Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 is unlikely to be toxic, infectious or pathogenic to earthworms, and therefore, a low risk is concluded for all representative uses from exposure to the microorganism. Insufficient data were available for assessing the effects of Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 on soil microorganism. This resulted in a data gap and assessment not finalised for soil microorganisms for all the representative uses evaluated including in permanent greenhouses (see Section 4.1). The RMS does not agree with the need for further data to address the risk to soil microorganisms as they consider a low risk can be concluded on the basis that microorganisms such as Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 after entering the soil will become part of the soil food web.Adequate data were available and indicated that Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 is unlikely to be toxic to non‐target plants, and therefore, a low risk to non‐target plants is concluded for all representative uses.In the manufacture by the applicant using the strain identifier F52 destruxins, cytochalasins and swainsonine were not detected in the MPCA/MPCP. Direct exposure from these secondary metabolites after application can be considered negligible and low risk to non‐target organisms is concluded (relevant for all representative uses). The production of these metabolites is considered limited under field conditions (see Sections 1 and 4.2).In the manufacture by the applicant using the strain identifier BIPESCO 5, cytochalasins were not detected and destruxins and swainsonine were not analysed for in the MPCA/MPCP. This resulted in a data gap (see Sections 1, 4.2 and 7). Should the secondary metabolites destruxin A, B, D and swainsonine be present in the MPCA/MPCP a hazard characterisation and risk assessment to non‐target organisms will be needed. A risk assessment to non‐target organisms would be needed if the exposure from these secondary metabolites in the MPCA/MPCP cannot be excluded. Therefore, a data gap and assessment not finalised is concluded (relevant for representative field and walk‐in tunnel uses). For representative uses in permanent structures and field/walk‐in tunnels (by manual soil incorporation), risk to non‐target aquatic organisms was considered low due to negligible exposure. For representative uses in permanent greenhouse risk to non‐target terrestrial organisms can be considered low due to negligible exposure.It should be noted in Section 3, it has not been excluded that for foliar spray applications Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 is endophytic and might be able to produce secondary metabolites in plants (see data gap in Section 7). If metabolites are present in plants exposure to non‐target organisms living on and/or feeding on plants cannot be excluded and a risk assessment may be needed.During the Pesticide Peer Review Meeting Teleconference 17 (June 2020), the risk assessment of Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52 and the secondary metabolite destruxin to birds was discussed. A risk assessment for small insectivorous birds from destruxins was available. It was noted in the experts’ meeting that the available data for the assessment of destruxins and other secondary metabolites are quite limited and indicate vast uncertainties. Overall experts noted that the evidence available is severely limited and insufficient to reach a conclusion of low risk. Some experts and the RMS expressed a view that the feeding study on birds, done on another strain, together with the background knowledge on the microorganism is sufficient to reach a conclusion on low risk. It was noted that no new data were provided to address the previous concerns to birds of the last EU level assessment (EFSA, 2012). Therefore, a low risk to birds cannot be concluded. With the available information for the assessment of mammals, the toxicological profile of destruxins and cytochalasins cannot be determined, and for the other possible metabolites, there was no toxicological information available (see Section 2). Therefore, this resulted in a data gap and an assessment not finalised for a hazard characterisation and risk assessment of the secondary metabolites e.g. destruxin A, B, D, cytochalasins and swainsonine to birds and mammals to address possible secondary poisoning from feeding on insects for the representative uses in field‐ and walk‐in tunnels. A low risk is concluded for the representative uses in permanent greenhouses.This is a list of data gaps identified during the peer review process, including those areas in which a study may have been made available during the peer review process but not considered for procedural reasons (without prejudice to the provisions of Article 56 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 concerning information on potentially harmful effects).\n\nA search of the scientific peer‐reviewed open literature on the active substance and its relevant metabolites, dealing with side effects on health and non‐target species and published within the 10 years before the date of submission of the dossier, to be conducted and reported in accordance with EFSA guidance on the submission of scientific peer‐reviewed open literature for the approval of pesticide active substances under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 (EFSA, 2011; relevant for all representative uses evaluated, relevant for Sections 2, 3, 5).\nAn applicant identified 54 articles on swainsonine in their literature review that were concluded to be relevant by the RMS in the RAR. A transparent evaluation of the reliability of these 54 articles was not presented in the RAR and the 54 articles were not included in the dossier, it remains an open question whether swainsonine is produced by the strain or not (relevant for all representative uses evaluated; see evaluation table Section 8 in the peer review report EFSA (2020) pertinent for Sections 3 and 4).\nGLP compliant 5‐batch data for the MCPA (relevant for applicant Novozymes; see Section 1).\nAmended study report outlining the determinations made for metabolites in the MPCA/MPCP (relevant for applicant Agrifutur; see Section 1).\nFinal report of the shelf‐life study (relevant for applicant Agrifutur; see Section 1).\nAerobic plate count data on additional product QC‐batches (pre‐storage only) to show that microbial contamination of batches is under control (relevant applicant Novozymes; see Section 1).\nComprehensive and up‐to‐date information regarding production of possible metabolites on plant commodities after application, including information on the metabolites’ identity, the expected concentrations and their fate and behaviour on plants, and an assessment of the relevance of these metabolites in terms of consumer exposure and consumer risk and potential exposure and risk to non‐target organisms, entailing the hazard potential of these metabolites might have to be addressed as well (relevant for all edible representative uses evaluated; see Sections 2, 3, 5).\nThe RAFBCA project (relevant dossier reference Butt et al., 2004) reports results regarding metabolite formation that were not carried out in GLP or officially recognised testing facilities. Many results reported in the project have not been published in peer‐reviewed scientific journals. A study on strain BIPESCO5/F52 in natural pond water was also not carried out in GLP or officially recognised testing facilities (relevant for all representative uses evaluated; see Section 4).\nAdditional information on the toxicity, infectiveness and pathogenicity to honeybees should be submitted (relevant for all the representative field and walk‐in tunnel uses evaluated; see Section 5).\nAdditional information on the impact on soil microorganisms should be submitted (relevant for all representative uses evaluated; see Section 5).\nAdditional information/assessment of production of secondary metabolites after application of Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO 5/F52, in plants, is required to further consider the different populations for risk assessment (relevant for all representative uses; see Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5).\n\n\n\nIn the absence of a quantitative risk assessment, the use of respiratory protective equipment (RPE) for the operators might be considered to reduce the exposure via inhalation (see Section 2).\n\nIn terms of uses in floriculture, ornamentals, tree nursery and non‐edible perennial crops, treated soil should not be recycled to grow edible crops as potential impact on consumer risk could from this situation could not be assessed (see Section 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/n\n\nslope of Freundlich isotherm\n\n\n\n\nλ\n\nwavelength\n\n\n\n\nε\n\ndecadic molar extinction coefficient\n\n\n\na.s. \nactive substance\n\n\n\nADE\n\nactual dermal exposure\n\n\n\n\nCFU\n\ncolony‐forming units\n\n\n\n\nCHO\n\nChinese hamster ovary cells\n\n\n\n\nCI\n\nconfidence interval\n\n\n\n\nCL\n\nconfidence limits\n\n\n\n\nEEC\n\nEuropean Economic Community\n\n\n\n\nEF1α\n\nElongation Factor 1α\n\n\n\n\nFAO\n\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n\n\n\n\nFID\n\nflame ionisation detector\n\n\n\n\nFIR\n\nfood intake rate\n\n\n\n\nFOB\n\nfunctional observation battery\n\n\n\n\nFOCUS\n\nForum for the Co‐ordination of Pesticide Fate Models and their Use\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nGC\n\ngas chromatography\n\n\n\n\nGLP\n\ngood laboratory practice\n\n\n\n\nGR\n\nGranule formulation\n\n\n\n\nGM\n\ngeometric mean\n\n\n\n\nGS\n\ngrowth stage\n\n\n\n\nHQ\n\nhazard quotient\n\n\n\n\nHR\n\nhazard rate\n\n\n\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organization for Standardization\n\n\n\n\nIUPAC\n\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n\n\n\n\niv\n\nintravenous\n\n\n\n\nLC\n\nliquid chromatography\n\n\n\n\nLC50\n\nlethal concentration, median\n\n\n\n\nLC‐MS\n\nliquid chromatography–mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nLC‐MS‐MS\n\nliquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nM/L\n\nmixing and loading\n\n\n\n\nmm\n\nmillimetre (also used for mean measured concentrations)\n\n\n\n\nmN\n\nmilli‐Newton\n\n\n\n\nMOA\n\nmode of action\n\n\n\n\nMRL\n\nmaximum residue level\n\n\n\n\nMPCA\n\nmicrobiological pest control agent\n\n\n\n\nMPCP\n\nmicrobiological pest control product\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nmass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nNOEL\n\nno observed effect level\n\n\n\n\nOECD\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development\n\n\n\n\nOM\n\norganic matter content\n\n\n\n\nOD\n\noil dispersion\n\n\n\n\nPa\n\nPascal\n\n\n\n\nPD\n\nproportion of different food types\n\n\n\n\nPEC\n\npredicted environmental concentration\n\n\n\n\nPHI\n\npreharvest interval\n\n\n\n\nPIE\n\npotential inhalation exposure\n\n\n\n\nPPE\n\npersonal protective equipment\n\n\n\n\nppm\n\nparts per million (10−6)\n\n\n\n\nPT\n\nproportion of diet obtained in the treated area\n\n\n\n\nRBC\n\nred blood cells\n\n\n\n\nREACH\n\nRegistration, Evaluation, Authorisation of Chemicals Regulation\n\n\n\n\nRPE\n\nrespiratory protective equipment\n\n\n\n\nSC\n\nsuspension concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSMILES\n\nsimplified molecular‐input line‐entry system\n\n\n\n\nSSR\n\nsimple sequence repeat\n\n\n\n\nTK\n\ntechnical concentrate\n\n\n\n\nTWA\n\ntime‐weighted average\n\n\n\n\nUV\n\nultraviolet\n\n\n\n\nW/S\n\nwater/sediment\n\n\n\n\nw/v\n\nweight per unit volume\n\n\n\n\nw/w\n\nweight per unit weight\n\n\n\n\nWBC\n\nwhite blood cell\n\n\n\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n"

No incompatibilities or interactions with feedingstuffs, carriers, other approved additives or medicinal drugs are expected. Halofuginone  r does not have antimicrobial activity at the highest dose proposed; it is not expected to exert adverse effects on chicken gut microbiota or select for resistance and cross‐resistance with other antimicrobials. The Panel cannot conclude on the genotoxic potential of halofuginone  r since an appropriate   follow‐up to exclude the mutagenic effect of the compound was not available. Therefore, the   Panel cannot conclude on the safety of halofuginone  r for the consumer. The additive is toxic by inhalation, dermal and ocular routes and is very irritant to both the eye and the skin. It is considered also a skin sensitiser. Inhalation exposure is considered a risk to persons handling the additive. Since the lack of genotoxic potential of halofuginone  r has not been adequately demonstrated, it should be considered as an additional potential concern to users handling the additive. Due to limitations in some of the ecotoxicological studies, no conclusions can be drawn on the safety of the additive for the environment.

        "summary": "The killing of cattle for human consumption (slaughtering) can take place in a slaughterhouse or on farm. The processes of slaughtering that were assessed for welfare, from the arrival of cattle until their death (including slaughtering without stunning), were grouped into three main phases: pre‐stunning (including arrival, unloading from the truck, lairage, handling and moving of cattle); stunning (including restraint); and bleeding. Stunning methods were grouped into two categories: mechanical and electrical. Twelve welfare consequences that cattle may be exposed to during slaughter were identified: heat stress, cold stress, fatigue, prolonged thirst, prolonged hunger, impeded movement, restriction of movements, resting problems (inability to rest or discomfort during resting), social stress, pain, fear and distress. Welfare consequences and their relevant animal‐based measures are described. In total, 40 welfare hazards that could occur during slaughter were identified and characterised, most of them related to stunning and bleeding. Staff were identified as the origin of 39 hazards, which were attributed to the lack of appropriate skill sets needed to perform tasks or to fatigue. Measures to prevent and correct hazards were identified, and structural and managerial measures were identified as those with a crucial role in prevention. Outcome tables linking hazards, welfare consequences, animal‐based measures, origin of hazards, and preventive and corrective measures were developed for each process. Mitigation measures to minimise welfare consequences are proposed.",
        "full-text": "In 2009, the European Union (EU) adopted Council Regulation (EC) No 1099/2009 ‘on the protection of animals at the time of killing’, based on two scientific Opinions adopted by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA, 2004, 2006). In 2013, EFSA published another scientific Opinion related to this subject (EFSA AHAW Panel, 2013).In parallel, since 2005, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has developed two chapters in its Terrestrial Animal Health Code: i) Slaughter of animals (Chapter 7.5), and ii) Killing of animals for disease control purposes (Chapter 7.6). OIE has created an ad hoc working group (WG) to revise these two chapters.Against this background, the European Commission requested EFSA to write a scientific Opinion providing an independent view on the slaughter of cattle.With specific reference to arrival of the animals, unloading, lairage, handling and moving to the stunning area, restraint, stunning and bleeding, EFSA was asked to: identify the animal welfare hazards and their possible origins in terms of facilities/equipment and staff (Term of Reference (ToR)‐1); define qualitative or measurable criteria to assess performance on animal welfare (animal‐based measures (ABMs)) (ToR‐2); provide preventive and corrective measures (structural or managerial) to address the hazards identified (ToR‐3); and point out specific hazards related to species or type of animal (e.g. breeding bulls, young calves) (ToR‐4). In addition, the European Commission asked EFSA to provide measures to mitigate the welfare consequences that can be caused by the identified hazards.This scientific Opinion aims at updating the above reported EFSA outputs by reviewing the most recent scientific publications and providing the European Commission with a sound scientific basis for future discussions at international level on the welfare of cattle in the context of slaughtering.The mandate also requested a list of unacceptable methods, procedures or practices that need to be analysed in terms of the above welfare aspects. It has to be noted that methods, procedures or practices cannot be subjected to a risk assessment procedure if there is no published scientific evidence related to them. Chapter 7.5.10 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code includes a list of several unacceptable practices and the Panel agrees with this list. In addition, the Panel listed some practices that lead to serious welfare concerns. These practices should be avoided, re‐designed or replaced by other practices, leading to better welfare outcomes.Council Regulation (EC) No 1099/2009 defines slaughtering as ‘the killing of animals intended for human consumption’ and the related operations are ‘operations that take place in the context and at the location where the animals are slaughtered’. This scientific opinion concerns the killing of cattle for human consumption that could take place in a slaughterhouse or during on‐farm slaughter. In the context of this Opinion, each related operation is a process, and several related operations (processes) are grouped in phases. The phases that have been assessed in this Opinion, from arrival until the animal is dead (including slaughtering without stunning), are: Phase 1 – pre‐stunning, Phase 2 – stunning, and Phase 3 – bleeding. Phase 1 includes the following processes (in chronological order): a) arrival, b) unloading of the animals from the truck, c) lairage, and d) handling and moving to the stunning area. Because restraint prior to stunning varies depending on the stunning method, restraint is assessed as a part of the relevant stunning method (Phase 2). The bleeding phase (Phase 3) includes exsanguination following stunning and slaughter without stunning.To address the mandate, three main approaches were used in developing this Opinion: i) literature search and ii) consultation of Member State (MS) representatives, followed by iii) expert opinion through WG discussion. The literature search was carried out to identify peer reviewed scientific evidence providing information on the elements requested by the ToRs (i.e. description of the processes, identification of welfare hazards and their origin, preventive and corrective measures, welfare consequences and related ABMs) on the topic of slaughter of cattle (killing of cattle for human consumption). During the 2019 meeting of the representatives of the EU Member States’ organisations designated as National Contact Points (NCPs) for Council Regulation (EC) No 1099/2009 (NCPs Network meeting1), hazards pertaining to each process of slaughtering were identified and discussed to gather information on the most common issues in the EU and which issues are considered by national authorities as the most urgent to be addressed in order to safeguard the welfare of cattle during slaughtering.From the available literature, their own knowledge and the results of the discussion with the NCPs Network, the WG experts identified the processes that should be included in the assessment and produced a list containing the possible welfare hazards of each process related to the slaughter of cattle. To address the ToRs, experts identified the origin of each hazard (ToR‐1) and related preventive and corrective measures (ToR‐3), along with the possible welfare consequences of the hazards and relevant ABMs (ToR‐2). Measures to mitigate the welfare consequences were also considered. Specific hazards were identified in the case of certain categories of cattle (e.g. breeding bulls, unweaned calves, buffaloes, bison) (ToR‐4). In addition, uncertainty analysis on the hazard identification was carried out, but limited to quantification of the probability of occurrence of false‐positive (included but non‐existent) or false‐negative (existing but not‐included) hazards.As this Opinion will be used by the European Commission to address the OIE standards, more methods for slaughter than those reported in Council Regulation (EC) No 1099/2009 were considered. For inclusion of these methods in the Opinion, the following criteria were applied: a) all methods with described technical specifications known to the experts, not only those described in Council Regulation (EC) No 1099/2009, and b) methods currently used for slaughter of cattle as well as those still in development but likely to become commercially applicable, and c) methods for which the welfare aspects (in terms of welfare hazards, welfare consequences, ABMs, preventive and corrective measures) are described sufficiently in the scientific literature. Applying these criteria, some methods that may be applied worldwide have not been included in the current assessment.For each process related to slaughter, a description on how it is technically and practically carried out is provided. In addition, the relevant welfare consequences and ABMs are identified (ToR‐2). A list of the main hazards associated with the relevant welfare consequences is provided (ToR‐1).The stunning methods that have been identified as relevant for cattle can be grouped in two categories: mechanical and electrical. The mechanical methods include penetrative and non‐penetrative captive bolt stunning as well as stunning using firearms with free projectiles. Electrical methods include head‐only and head‐to‐body stunning. Because of the diversity of available stunning methods, this Opinion considered the assessment of welfare consequences, hazards, related ABMs and mitigation measures, origin of hazards and preventive/corrective actions for each method.In total, 12 welfare consequences were identified: heat stress, cold stress, fatigue, prolonged thirst, prolonged hunger, impeded movement, restriction of movements, resting problems, social stress, pain, fear and distress. Cattle experience welfare consequences due to the presence of hazards only when they are conscious, which applies to all cattle during the pre‐stunning phase. In the stunning phase, cattle may experience welfare consequences if hazards occur during restraint (before stunning), if induction of unconsciousness is not immediate, or if stunning is ineffective. During bleeding following stunning, cattle will experience welfare consequences in case of persistence of consciousness or if they recover consciousness after stunning and before death. During slaughter without stunning the animals will experience welfare consequences until they become unconscious due to loss of blood or until post‐cut stunning is applied.The mandate requested to provide definitions of qualitative or measurable (quantitative) criteria to assess performance (i.e. consequences) on animal welfare (ABMs; ToR‐2); this ToR was addressed by identifying the welfare consequences occurring to cattle during slaughter and the relevant ABMs that can be used to assess qualitatively or quantitatively these welfare consequences. Lists and definitions of ABMs to be used for assessing the welfare consequences have been provided in this Opinion. ABMs for the assessment of all the welfare consequences have been identified, except for prolonged hunger and prolonged thirst at the time of arrival. However, under certain circumstances, not all the ABMs can be used because of low feasibility (e.g. at arrival/during lairage due to the lack of accessibility to the animals in the truck/pen). Even if welfare consequences cannot be assessed during the slaughter of cattle, it does not imply they do not exist. It is to be noted that ABMs during stunning are the signs of consciousness, since consciousness is the prerequisite for animals to experience pain and fear during stunning. These ABMs of consciousness are specific to the stunning methods and were proposed in a previous EFSA Opinion (EFSA AHAW Panel, 2013). Flow charts, including ABMs of consciousness to be used for monitoring of stunning efficacy, are reproduced in this Opinion in order to provide the European Commission with the full welfare assessment at slaughter.In answering ToR‐1, 40 hazards related to the previous welfare consequences from arrival of the cattle at the slaughter slaughterhouse until they are dead were identified. The main hazards are associated with lack of staff skills and training, and poorly designed and constructed facilities.Animal welfare consequences can be the result of one or more hazards. Exposure to multiple hazards has a cumulative effect on the welfare consequences (e.g. pain due to injury caused at arrival will lead to more severe pain during unloading). Some hazards are inherent to the stunning method and cannot be avoided (e.g. restraint), other hazards originate from sub‐optimal application of the method, mainly due to unskilled staff (e.g. inappropriate handling, use of wrong parameters for electrical methods). In fact, the majority of the hazards (39 out of 40) have staff as origin, and hazards can be attributed to the lack of appropriate skills to perform tasks or to fatigue.The uncertainty analysis on the set of hazards provided for each process in this Opinion revealed that the experts were 95–99% certain that all listed hazards occur during slaughter of cattle. However, the experts were 90–95% certain that at least one hazard was missing in the assessment, considering the three criteria for the inclusion of methods and practices in this Opinion as presented above.Furthermore, from a global perspective, the experts were 95–99% certain that at least one welfare hazard was missing. This is due to the lack of documented evidence on all possible variations in the processes and methods being practised (see Interpretation of ToRs on the criteria for selection of stunning/killing methods to be included).In response to ToR‐3, preventive and corrective measures have been identified and described. Some are specific for a particular hazard; others can apply to multiple hazards (e.g. staff training and rotation). For most hazards, preventive measures can be put in place with management having a crucial role in prevention. However, for some hazards related to restraint and bleeding when slaughtering without stunning, no preventive measures could be identified. Corrective measures were identified for 28 hazards. When no corrective measures are available or feasible to put in place, actions to mitigate the welfare consequences caused by the identified hazards should be put in place.Finally, outcome tables linking all the elements (welfare hazards, origin of hazards, preventive and corrective measures, welfare consequences and related ABMs) were produced for each process in the slaughter of cattle to provide an overall and concise outcome. Conclusions and recommendations are provided, subdivided for the specific phases of slaughter addressed in this Opinion.To spare cattle from severe welfare consequences, a standard operating procedure (SOP) should include identification of hazards and related welfare consequences, using relevant ABMs, as well as preventive and corrective measures. At arrival, cattle should be unloaded as soon as possible and those with severe pain, signs of illness, or those unable to move independently, should be inspected and a procedure for emergency slaughter should be applied immediately. Keeping cattle in lairage should be avoided, unless it benefits their welfare. Permanent access to water, adequate space and protection from adverse weather conditions should always be ensured during lairage. Restraining, stunning and slaughter methods, which cause severe pain and fear, should not be used. To monitor stunning method efficacy, the state of consciousness of the animals should be checked immediately after stunning, just prior to neck cutting and during bleeding. Death must be confirmed before carcass processing begins.This mandate asks EFSA to provide an independent view on the slaughter of cattle for human consumption, covering all parts of the slaughter process. The scientific Opinion focuses on the identification of hazards leading to negative cattle welfare consequences at slaughter. The hazards, their origins, preventive and corrective measures, welfare consequences and related animal‐based measures have been identified on the ground of literature search and expert Opinion and takes into account the common slaughter practices that have been reported in the Opinion.Not all the methods, procedures and practices for slaughter of cattle used worldwide are documented. Due to the lack of adequate description or scientific validation, a hazard analysis was not carried out for these methods, procedures or practices.Outcome tables have been prepared to summarise the main results of this Opinion and include a concise presentation of all retrieved information.\n\n\n\n\nABM\n\nanimal‐based measure\n\n\n\n\nAHAW\n\nEFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare\n\n\n\n\nBW\n\nbody weight\n\n\n\n\nDBT\n\ndry bulb air temperature\n\n\n\n\nECoG\n\nelectrocorticogram\n\n\n\n\nEEG\n\nelectroencephalogram\n\n\n\n\nFAWC\n\nFarm Animal Welfare Council\n\n\n\n\nHALF\n\nhigh‐amplitude low‐frequency waves\n\n\n\n\nHSA\n\nHumane Slaughter Association\n\n\n\n\nLAPS\n\nlow atmosphere pressure system\n\n\n\n\nLCT\n\nlower critical temperature\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nMember State\n\n\n\n\nNCP\n\nNational Contact Point\n\n\n\n\nOIE\n\nWorld Organisation for Animal Health\n\n\n\n\nRH\n\nrelative humidity\n\n\n\n\nSCAHAW\n\nScientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare\n\n\n\n\nSEP\n\nsomatosensory evoked potential\n\n\n\n\nSPUC\n\nsingle pulse of ultra‐high electrical current\n\n\n\n\nTHI\n\ntemperature–humidity index\n\n\n\n\nTNZ\n\nthermoneutral zone\n\n\n\n\nToR\n\nTerm of Reference\n\n\n\n\nUCT\n\nupper critical temperature\n\n\n\n\nVEP\n\nvisual evoked potential\n\n\n\n\nWBT\n\nwet bulb air temperature\n\n\n\n\nWG\n\nworking group\n\n\n"

The context of the peer review was that required by Commission Implementing Regulation ( ) No 844/2012, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation ( ) No 2018/1659. The conclusions were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of   ssp.   strain  ‐91 as an insecticide on pome fruits (apple, pear), grapes and sports turf (field uses) and tomato (greenhouse uses).

        "full-text": "Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/1659, lays down the procedure for the renewal of the approval of active substances submitted under Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. The list of those substances is established in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 686/2012. Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 is one of the active substances listed in Regulation (EU) No 686/2012.In accordance with Article 1 of Regulation (EU) No 844/2012, the rapporteur Member State (RMS), The Netherlands, and co‐rapporteur Member State (co‐RMS), Germany, received an application from Certis USA LLC for the renewal of approval of the active substance Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91.An initial evaluation of the dossier on Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 was provided by the RMS in the renewal assessment report (RAR) and subsequently, a peer review of the pesticide risk assessment on the RMS evaluation was conducted by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in accordance with Article 13 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/1659. The following conclusions are derived.The uses of Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 according to the representative uses as an insecticide on pome fruits against Cydia pomonella, on grapes against Lobesia botrana and Eupoecilia ambiguella, on turf against Spodoptera spp. and on protected tomato (greenhouse, walk‐in tunnels) against Tuta absoluta, as proposed at the European Union (EU) level, result in a sufficient insecticidal efficacy against the target insect pests.The assessment of the data package revealed no issues that need to be included as critical areas of concern with respect to the identity of the active substance, physical and technical properties of the representative formulation.In the area of mammalian toxicology, potential adverse effects after repeated exposure by inhalation to Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 and genotoxic potential of the insecticidal proteins by non‐dietary exposure could not be excluded. On this basis, the risk assessment for residents and bystanders cannot be concluded (issue not finalised).In the area of residues a data gap was identified related to the proposed threshold of 1 × 105 colony forming units (CFU)/g for viable residues on edible plant commodities at the time of harvest for the representative uses on pome fruits grapes and tomatoes, where quantification of viable counts of Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 linked to specific preharvest intervals (PHIs) is requested to finalise the consumer dietary risk assessment.Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 is not proposed to be included into Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/20051 because limited available residue data do not allow to conclude on a general basis that residues will always be below the threshold of 105 CFU/g at harvest.In the area of environmental fate and behaviour, the available information was considered sufficient to complete the necessary environmental exposure assessments.Satisfactory information was not provided leading to issues not being finalised for the potential for toxicity, infectivity and pathogenicity to bees and non‐target arthropods for representative field and walk‐in tunnel uses; the potential for infectivity and pathogenicity to earthworms for all representative uses and for a hazard characterisation and an assessment of the risk to non‐target organisms from toxins/secondary metabolites such as crystal proteins.Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/20122, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/16593, (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Regulation’), lays down the provisions for the procedure of the renewal of the approval of active substances, submitted under Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/20094. This regulates for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) the procedure for organising the consultation of Member States, the applicant(s) and the public on the initial evaluation provided by the rapporteur Member State (RMS) and/or co‐rapporteur Member State (co‐RMS) in the renewal assessment report (RAR), and the organisation of an expert consultation where appropriate.In accordance with Article 13 of the Regulation, unless formally informed by the European Commission that a conclusion is not necessary, EFSA is required to adopt a conclusion on whether the active substance can be expected to meet the approval criteria provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 within 5 months from the end of the period provided for the submission of written comments, subject to an extension of up to 3 months where additional information is required to be submitted by the applicant(s) in accordance with Article 13(3).In accordance with Article 1 of the Regulation, the RMS The Netherlands and co‐RMS Germany received an application from Certis USA LLC for the renewal of approval of the active substance Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91. Complying with Article 8 of the Regulation, the RMS checked the completeness of the dossier and informed the applicant, the co‐RMS (Germany), the European Commission and EFSA about the admissibility.The RMS provided its initial evaluation of the dossier on Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 in the RAR, which was received by EFSA on 31 July 2018 (The Netherlands, 2018).In accordance with Article 12 of the Regulation, EFSA distributed the RAR to the Member States and the applicant, Certis USA LLC, for consultation and comments on 2 April 2019. EFSA also provided comments. In addition, EFSA conducted a public consultation on the RAR. EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the European Commission on 2 June 2019. At the same time, the collated comments were forwarded to the RMS for compilation and evaluation in the format of a reporting table. The applicant was invited to respond to the comments in column 3 of the reporting table. The comments and the applicant's response were evaluated by the RMS in column 3.The need for expert consultation and the necessity for additional information to be submitted by the applicant in accordance with Article 13(3) of the Regulation were considered in a telephone conference between EFSA and the RMS on 27 August 2019. On the basis of the comments received, the applicant's response to the comments and the RMS's evaluation thereof, it was concluded that additional information should be requested from the applicant, and that EFSA should conduct an expert consultation in the areas of effects on human health of the microorganism and of the plant protection product and environmental fate and behaviour.The outcome of the telephone conference, together with EFSA's further consideration of the comments, is reflected in the conclusions set out in column 4 of the reporting table. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase and which required further consideration, including those issues to be considered in an expert consultation, were compiled by EFSA in the format of an evaluation table.The conclusions arising from the consideration by EFSA, and as appropriate by the RMS, of the points identified in the evaluation table, together with the outcome of the expert consultation and the written consultation on the assessment of additional information, where these took place, were reported in the final column of the evaluation table.A final consultation on the conclusions arising from the peer review of the risk assessment took place with Member States via a written procedure in August‐September 2020.This conclusion report summarises the outcome of the peer review of the risk assessment of the active substance and the representative formulation, evaluated on the basis of the representative uses of Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 as an insecticide on pome fruits (apple, pear), grapes, sports turf and tomato, as proposed by the applicant. In accordance with Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, risk mitigation options identified in the RAR and considered during the peer review are presented in the conclusion. A list of the relevant end points for the active substance and the formulation is provided in Appendix A.In addition, a key supporting document to this conclusion is the peer review report (EFSA, 2020), which is a compilation of the documentation developed to evaluate and address all issues raised in the peer review, from the initial commenting phase to the conclusion. The peer review report comprises the following documents, in which all views expressed during the course of the peer review, including minority views, where applicable, can be found:\n\nthe comments received on the RAR;\nthe reporting table (28 August 2019);\nthe evaluation table (29 September 2020);\nthe report(s) of the scientific consultation with Member State experts (where relevant);\nthe comments received on the assessment of the additional information (where relevant);\nthe comments received on the draft EFSA conclusion.\nGiven the importance of the RAR, including its revisions (The Netherlands, 2020), and the peer review report, both documents are considered as background documents to this conclusion and thus are made publicly available.It is recommended that this conclusion report and its background documents would not be accepted to support any registration outside the European Union (EU) for which the applicant has not demonstrated that it has regulatory access to the information on which this conclusion report is based.Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 is a bacterium deposited at the National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC), at the Health Protection Agency, Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response, Porton Down, Salisbury, UK under the reference number NCTC 11821. Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 is a transconjugant strain, not genetically modified.The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ‘Agree 50 WG’, a water‐dispersible granule (WG) containing 500 g/kg of Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 (min. 3.1 × 1013 colony forming units (CFU)/kg, max. 4 × 1013 CFU/kg) with a biopotency of min. 25,000 IU/mg.The representative uses evaluated were field spray applications on pome fruits against Cydia pomonella, on grapes against Lobesia botrana and Eupoecilia ambiguella, on turf against Spodoptera spp. and on protected tomato (greenhouse, walk‐in tunnels) against Tuta absoluta in the EU. Full details of the Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) can be found in the list of end points in Appendix A.Data were submitted to conclude that the use of Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 according to the representative uses proposed at EU level results in a sufficient insecticidal efficacy against the target organisms, following the guidance document SANCO/2012/11251‐rev. 4 (European Commission, 2014b).The following guidance documents were followed in the production of this conclusion: SANCO/12116/2012–rev. 0 (European Commission, 2012) and Guidance on the assessment of bacterial susceptibility to antimicrobials of human and veterinary importance (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 2018).Based on the scientific progress on the taxonomy of the Bacillus cereus group in general and that of Bacillus thuringiensis in particular, it was proposed that Bacillus cereus sensu stricto and Bacillus thuringiensis are in fact one and the same species which differ only in some phenotypic traits. Nevertheless, a proposal has been put forward which maintains the current species assignment. Accordingly, both the phenotypic assignment ‘Bacillus thuringiensis serovar aizawai’ and the phylogenetic assignment ‘Bacillus cereus sensu stricto serovar aizawai biovar Thuringiensis’ would be valid for strain GC‐91. For taxonomic conservation, ‘ssp.’ is used throughout this conclusion.GC‐91 is not a mutant but a transconjugant strain, incorporating genes from two different Bacillus thuringiensis strains. This strain has flagella serotype aizawai and δ‐endotoxin genes mixture kurstaki‐aizawai. Morphological and biochemical characterisation, serotyping, plasmid profiling, activity spectrum, fatty acid analysis, DNA fingerprinting (amplified fragment length polymorphism; AFLP), crystal insecticidal (Cry) proteins toxin analysis, strain specific markers can be used to clearly identify strain GC‐91.The technical grade microbial pest control agent (MPCA) used for manufacturing of the formulated product (microbial pest control product; MPCP) contains minimum 6.2 × 1013 CFU/kg and maximum 7.9 × 1013 CFU/kg Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91, with a minimum biopotency of 50,000 IU/mg. The δ‐endotoxin content of the MPCA was 80 g/kg; however, a data gap was identified for recent 5‐batch data which includes the δ‐endotoxin content. The δ‐endotoxin is stated to be constituted by the Cry1Ac, Cry1C, Cry1D and Cry2A proteins, which are those reported to be expressed by the strain.Whole genome sequence (chromosomal and plasmids) was screened for the genes coding for exotoxins and enterotoxins. Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 lacks the majority of genes required for exotoxin production and lacks haemolysin II (HlyII) encoding genes. Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 contains genes for one cytotoxin K (type Cyt K2), three genes related to non‐haemolytic enterotoxins and eight genes related to haemolytic enterotoxins, of which three are located on plasmid 2. Genes for cereulide biosynthesis are missing in the Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 genome. The genetic determinants for the typical Bacillus subtilis/amyloliquefaciens metabolites in the genome of Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 showed that none of the substances iturin A, bacillomycin D, mycosubtilisin, surfactin, fengycin, entomicin 110, zwittermycin can be produced by the strain, except for zwittermycin A.The content of microbial contaminants of the MPCP was below the limits defined in the SANCO/12116/2012 working document (European commission, 2012). Bacillus thuringiensis spores can remain viable for years in soil, but applied as a spray, the δ‐endotoxins are rapidly degradable and endospores are rapidly inactivated when exposed to UV radiation.As a member of the Bacillus cereus group, Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai is closely related to Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus cereus. Bacillus thuringiensis strains are however distinguishable from Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthracis. Bacillus cytotoxicus is known to produce the highly cytotoxic variant of CytK, the CytK‐1, which is not produced by any of the other members of this group.Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 was sensitive to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, streptomycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, kanamycin, gentamycin and vancomycin but not sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin. Resistance to β‐lactam antibiotics is intrinsic.Strains of thuringiensis are capable of plasmid and gene transfer. However, during manufacture, the Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 was proven to be stable by regular quality control checks.The main data regarding the identity of Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 and its biological properties are given in Appendix A.Acceptable methods for CFU counts of Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 in the formulation for the determination of the microorganism in the MPCP and for the determination of the content of contaminating microorganisms are available.Methods for the determination and quantification of residues are currently not required as no residue definition applies to the microorganism and maximum residue level (MRL) have not been set for any of the intended uses. However, it is noted that a validated enumeration method in high water commodities (lettuce) is available with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1.3 × 103 CFU/g and unambiguous identification of colonies of Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. azawai strain GC‐91 can be achieved using DNA fingerprinting AFLP markers. The methods can be used for monitoring of the strain upon field application.Methods of analysis for viable residues in the environment are not required.Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 was discussed at the Pesticides Peer Review Meeting Teleconference 25 in March 2020.\nGeneral data\nFrom the medical data, no adverse reactions or sensitisation reactions due to Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 exposure were reported during production, formulation, handling of microbial products, filling and packaging. The results of allergenicity observations indicate that increased IgE antibodies levels can occur in greenhouses workers exposed to products containing Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. kurstaki and aizawai but no effect on the occurrence of respiratory symptoms or lung function was observed. Bacillus thuringiensis is not recommended for the Qualified Presumption of Safety list (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2020).\nToxicity/infectivity/pathogenicity studies\nAs the available methods for testing dermal sensitisation are not suitable for testing microorganisms and there are no validate test methods for sensitisation by inhalation, the following warning phrase is proposed: ‘Contains Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91. Micro‐organisms may have the potential to provoke sensitising reactions’.On the basis of the acute studies submitted for Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91, there is no evidence that the microorganism may cause acute oral, intraperitoneal or intravenous toxicity, pathogenicity or infectivity in mammals. Regarding the acute inhalation, the incomplete lung clearance in one study did not allow to exclude a potential for infectivity. Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 was not skin or eye irritant. Studies on acute oral, inhalation, dermal toxicity were also submitted for the formulation ‘Agree 50 WP’.No genotoxicity studies were reported given that no validated methods are currently available for microorganisms.With regard to repeated dose toxicity by oral exposure, no adverse effects were observed in a 90‐day rat study with Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91. As regards short‐term toxicity by inhalation, in a literature study a lung interstitial inflammation was observed in mice after repeated exposure by inhalation (2 × 5 days) to products containing Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis and Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki, and was still present 70 days after the exposure.5 The adversity and possible treatment relationship of the finding of the interstitial lung inflammation were discussed during the experts’ meeting considered also applicable to Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strains. The potential concern for adverse health effects after repeated exposure by inhalation could not be excluded for the intended field uses on the basis of the available data (data gap).5 This was agreed by the majority of experts.\nSecondary metabolites/toxins\nBacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 can produce certain enterotoxin and δ‐endotoxin (Cry1Ac, Cry1C, Cry1D and Cry2A insecticidal proteins) (see Section 1). However, humans and other mammals will not be directly exposed to enterotoxins as they are inactivated at low pH in the stomach.Based on the available evidence, the peer review concluded that only the spores are able to survive the stomach passage and to germinate and produce enterotoxins in the intestinal tract (potentially leading to diarrhoeal‐associated food‐borne disease in humans). RMS and co‐RMS did not agree.6In a mouse micronucleus study with intraperitoneal administration, positive results were observed with the spore‐crystal complex containing Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac and Cry2Aa. These results were considered equivocal especially regarding whether the Cry proteins had been solubilised/activated prior to administration or not (data gap). It was concluded that genotoxicity of the insecticidal proteins is not a concern for dietary exposure but a possible concern for non‐dietary exposure could not be excluded.7 This was agreed by the majority of experts.\nReference values and exposure estimates\nFor the representative uses on turf sports, pome fruits, grapes, and solanaceous fruits by professional and non‐professional users, the threshold of 105 CFU/g food as determined by the BIOHAZ Panel Opinion (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2016) was concluded as applicable to all Bacillus thuringiensis to cover the risk of food‐borne poisonings caused by the Bacillus cereus group of microorganisms (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2016), has to be taken into account. RMS and co‐RMS did not agree.6With regard to non‐dietary exposure, toxicity/infectivity after repeated exposure to Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 by inhalation could not be concluded, and a genotoxic potential of the Cry proteins could not be excluded. Therefore, the risk assessment by inhalation for residents and bystanders for field uses cannot be concluded for the microorganism and the Cry proteins (issue not finalised except for permanent greenhouses). In the absence of a quantitative risk assessment, the use of respiratory protective equipment for the operators and workers might be considered to reduce the exposure via inhalation (for field and greenhouse uses).Bacillus thuringiensis strains were discussed at the Pesticides Peer Review Meeting Teleconference 25 in March 2020.Considering the available evidence and uncertainties, the threshold of 105 CFU/g plant commodity at the time of harvest as determined by the BIOHAZ Panel Opinion (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2016) is considered applicable to all Bacillus thuringiensis strains to cover the risk of food‐borne poisonings (caused by the Bacillus cereus group of microorganisms; see Section 2). Non‐viable residues are not of concern for the dietary consumption (see Section 2). The RMS wished to inform that work was ongoing on the development of a new diagnostic tool to discriminate Bacillus thuringiensis biocontrol strains from Bacillus cereus sensu lato species and strains. The expectation is that a tool would become available to distinguish between Bacillus cereus senso lato strains and commercial Bacillus thuringiensis strains and to ensure correct conclusions and decisions can be taken with regard to the origin of food borne outbreaks.Therefore, only information on viable residues, i.e. CFU per g or kg of Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 on plant commodities at harvest is needed to demonstrate that the threshold of 105 CFU/g edible plant commodity is not exceeded.To ensure this, the setting of a preharvest interval (PHI) may be needed. For greenhouse tomatoes, considering a slightly higher application rate of the representative use on tomatoes, mean viable counts of around 6.5 × 104 CFU/g can be estimated.Residue data provided for greenhouse lettuce indicate CFU following treatment of up to 5.4 × 104 CFU/g. However, when proportionality was applied from the dose rate applied to lettuce compared to the applied dose rates on pome fruits and grapes of the representative uses which is around two times higher, the threshold of 105 CFU/g maybe exceeded. Lettuce samples were stored frozen at −18°C prior to analysis. The storage time is not indicated. Therefore, the residue trials on lettuce are considered as supporting information only.A calculated estimate of viable spore counts on grapes following treatment with a slightly lower application rate than the representative use was performed and counts between 3.7 and 7.4 × 106 CFU/g were estimated.Viable counts of commercial Bacillus thuringiensis strains were demonstrated in the scientific literature and by supporting experimental evidence to decline following application and not to persist or multiply on edible plant commodities (fruiting vegetables and leafy crops). Furthermore, in the literature a body of evidence supports inactivation and decline of viable spores by environmental factors such as solar radiation, rainfall, plant growth and temperature. Based on the available data, a half‐life of viable spores of up to 1 day or 24 h can reasonably be assumed.Since measured residue levels are below however close to the threshold of 1 × 105 CFU/g for tomatoes, indicatively above the threshold for lettuce and based on a calculated estimate on grape wine leaves (maximally around 107 CFU/g when considering a ca. 1.4 times higher application rate of the representative use), a data gap on viable counts of Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 linked to specific PHIs for the representative uses on pome fruits, grapes and tomatoes considering uncertainties related to variability of viable counts (see also data gap in Section 1) needs to be addressed before a consumer risk assessment can be finalised (issue that could not be finalised).Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 is not proposed to be included into Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/20051 because the few available residue data do not allow to conclude on a general basis that residues are always below the threshold of 105 CFU/g at harvest.Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 was discussed at the Pesticides Peer Review Meeting Teleconference 25 in March 2020.Satisfactory information was provided in relation to potential interference of Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 with the analytical systems for the control of the quality of drinking water provided for in Directive 98/83/EC8 (see specific Annex VI decision making criteria in Part II Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/20119). It was concluded that Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 is unlikely to interfere with the methodologies routinely used for such determinations.Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 is a transconjugant of two ‘wild‐type’ strains and there are no marker genes in the strain which would permit analysis of a frequency of genetic exchange. Though it is acknowledged that the possibility and effects of transfer of genetic material is not different for Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 than for other naturally occurring Bacillus thuringiensis strains, transfer of genetic material by Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 after application is possible (the strain has plasmids), so could not be excluded based on the information in the dossier. Information in the dossier confirms that plasmid exchange between vegetative cells of different strains of the species can be measured when applications were made to leaf surfaces. Note the applied material in the product is spores and not vegetative cells.Specific environmental exposure estimates for greenhouse uses were not provided. The applicant chose to address the representative use on protected tomato by stating that greenhouse uses are covered by the exposure assessments provided for the field uses.Some toxicity, infectiveness and pathogenicity studies on birds for Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 were available and did not indicate any adverse effects. Based on the lack of toxicity or pathogenicity in the available studies, a low risk was concluded (relevant for all representative uses).As concluded in Section 2, sufficient information is available to finalise the assessment of infectivity and pathogenicity of Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 in mammals. A low risk to wild mammals was concluded (relevant for all representative uses).Adequate studies were available with aquatic organisms showing no infectivity and pathogenicity to aquatic organisms from Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91. Based on the lack of toxicity, infectivity and pathogenicity in the available studies, a low risk to aquatic organisms was concluded for all representative uses.Insufficient data were available to address toxicity, infectivity and pathogenicity to bees from Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91. Consequently, a data gap leading to an assessment not finalised was identified for the representative uses in open field and in walk‐in tunnels. The RMS disagreed. Low risk identified for representative uses in permanent greenhouses as the exposure to bees is expected to be negligible.Insufficient data were available to address toxicity, infectivity and pathogenicity to non‐target arthropods from Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91. Consequently, a data gap leading to an assessment not finalised was identified to non‐target arthropods for the representative uses in open field and walk‐in tunnels. The RMS disagreed. For representative uses in permanent greenhouses, the risk is low as the exposure to non‐target arthropods is expected to be negligible.For representative uses in permanent greenhouses, a risk assessment to soil organisms is required as spores of the strain are expected to persist and be present above natural background levels in soil (see Section 4.1). Insufficient information was available to address infectivity or pathogenicity to earthworms from exposure to Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91. Consequently, a data gap leading to an assessment not finalised was identified for the all representative uses. The RMS disagreed. Adequate data were available demonstrating the effects of Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 on soil microorganism and therefore a low risk is concluded for all representative uses.Adequate data were available and indicated that Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. aizawai strain GC‐91 is unlikely to be toxic to non‐target plants and therefore a low risk to non‐target plants is concluded for all representative uses.The risk assessment of toxins/secondary metabolites such as crystal proteins could not be finalised for non‐target terrestrial organisms, due to the lack of toxicity data resulting in data gap and issue not finalised (relevant for representative field‐ and walk‐in tunnel uses). The RMS disagreed.The risk assessment of toxins/secondary metabolites such as crystal proteins could not be finalised for non‐target aquatic organisms, due to the lack of toxicity data resulting in data gap and issue not finalised (relevant for all representative uses).

        "full-text": "In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, Bayer SAS ‐ Crop Science Division submitted an application to the competent national authority in the Netherlands (evaluating Member State, EMS) to modify the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for the active substance flupyradifurone and its metabolite difluoroacetic acid (DFA) in rapeseeds/canola seeds and mustard seeds. The EMS drafted an evaluation report in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on 11 December 2019. To accommodate for the intended uses of flupyradifurone, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs for flupyradifurone in rapeseeds and mustard seeds from the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.01 to 0.3 mg/kg and to raise the existing MRLs for difluoroacetic acid (DFA) in rapeseeds and mustard seeds from the LOQ of 0.05 to 0.3 mg/kg.EFSA assessed the application and the evaluation report as required by Article 10 of the MRL regulation.Based on the conclusions derived by EFSA in the framework of the peer review of the pesticides risk assessment under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the data evaluated under previous MRL assessments and the additional data provided by the EMS in the framework of this application, the following conclusions are derived.The metabolism of flupyradifurone was investigated following foliar applications of the radiolabelled active substance on fruit crops, pulses/oilseeds and cereals, by soil granule/soil drench applications on fruit crops, root crops and cereals and by seed dressing on root crops. The EU pesticides peer review concluded that in primary crops, flupyradifurone was expected to be the major component. Following the soil application, significant proportions of difluoroacetic acid (DFA) were observed; the data from residue trials confirmed that DFA is a relevant plant metabolite of flupyradifurone.Studies investigating the effect of standard processing conditions on the nature of flupyradifurone (hydrolysis studies) demonstrated that the active substance is stable. Studies investigating the effect of processing on the nature of DFA are not available. However, considering the structural similarity of DFA with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), which is very stable under hydrolysis conditions, EFSA agrees with the applicant and EMS that DFA is unlikely to degrade under standard hydrolytic conditions.In rotational crops, the major residues identified were flupyradifurone, its metabolites flupyradifurone‐hydroxy, 6‐CNA and their conjugates, and DFA. The presence of DFA is mostly the result of its uptake from soil, where DFA is the major metabolite of flupyradifurone.Based on the metabolic pattern identified in primary and rotational crop metabolism studies, the results of hydrolysis studies, the toxicological significance of metabolites and the capabilities of enforcement analytical methods, the following residue definitions were agreed by the EU pesticides peer review:\n\n\n–Residue definition for risk assessment: Sum of flupyradifurone and DFA, expressed as flupyradifurone\n\n–Residue definitions for enforcement: 1) Flupyradifurone; 2) DFA, expressed as DFA\nThe same residue definitions are applicable to rotational crops and processed products.EFSA concluded that for the crops assessed in this application, metabolism of flupyradifurone in primary and in rotational crops, and the possible degradation in processed products have been addressed and that the previously derived residue definitions are applicable. Sufficiently validated analytical methods based on high‐performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy (HPLC‐MS/MS) are available to quantify residues of flupyradifurone and of DFA in oilseeds according to enforcement residue definitions.The available data are considered sufficient to derive MRL proposals as well as risk assessment values for flupyradifurone and DFA in mustard seeds and rapeseeds in support of the intended SEU use. The intended NEU use on mustard is not supported by compliant residue trials, whereas for the critical intended NEU use on oilseed rape, an MRL proposal was derived on the basis of a scaled residue data.Flupyradifurone exhibits high persistency in soil, forming DFA as its major soil metabolite. The formation of DFA in soil results in its uptake in rotational crops. Thus, the MRL proposal for DFA in rapeseeds and mustard seeds would need to account for residues that occur after direct treatment of the crop (primary crop treatment) and from the soil uptake. This estimate would lead to a higher MRL proposal of 0.4 mg/kg. Further risk management discussions are therefore recommended on whether MRL should be established to cover residues in rotational crops or whether other risk management options (e.g. plant back restrictions) would be appropriate to avoid DFA residues in untreated crops.The occurrence of flupyradifurone and DFA residues in rotational crops was investigated in the framework of the EU pesticides peer review and in the framework of the previous EFSA assessment. A wide range of rotational crop studies were available, which indicate a significant uptake of the metabolite DFA in rotational crops. Consequently, the MRL proposals for DFA in rotational crops were derived in the recent EFSA assessment. Since the annual application rate in the intended good agricultural practices (GAPs) on oilseed rape and mustard is significantly lower than the application rates on primary crops for which the residues of DFA in rotational crops were estimated in the previous EFSA assessment, the magnitude of DFA residues in rotational crops was not re‐assessed and the conclusions of the previous EFSA opinion are applicable.In the framework of the current application, processing studies with rapeseeds and mustard seeds were not submitted and are not required, considering the low contribution of residues in these crops to the total consumer exposure.Rapeseed meal can be used as feed item, and therefore, a potential carry‐over into food of animal origin was assessed. The previous EU livestock dietary burden calculation for the intake of flupyradifurone and DFA residues from imported feed and the EU feed items was updated with residue values for rapeseed meal from the new intended uses. When considering the livestock exposure to DFA residues, also the intake of this metabolite via rotational crops has been considered. The calculated livestock dietary burden exceeded the trigger value of 0.004 mg/kg bw day for all relevant livestock species. Since the contribution of flupyradifurone and DFA residues in rapeseed meal to the total EU livestock dietary burden is insignificant, the magnitude of residues in animal commodities was not further assessed. EFSA concludes that the residues in rapeseeds from the intended uses will not affect the residues in animal commodities as estimated in the previous EFSA assessment.The toxicological profile of flupyradifurone was assessed in the framework of the EU pesticides peer review and the data were sufficient to derive an acceptable daily intake (ADI) value of 0.064 mg/kg bw per day and an acute reference dose (ARfD) of 0.15 mg/kg bw. The toxicological reference values are also applicable to metabolite DFA.The consumer risk assessment was performed with revision 3.1 of the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo). EFSA performed two separate consumer exposure calculation scenarios in order to estimate the exposure to flupyradifurone and DFA residues from 1) treated primary crops and animal commodities, and 2) plant commodities that are grown as rotational crops (no primary treatment). Acute exposure was calculated only for the crops under consideration.The calculated chronic exposure under scenario 1 accounted for a maximum of 54% of the ADI (NL toddler diet). The contribution of residues in rapeseeds and mustard seeds to the total consumer exposure was low: 0.34% of the ADI (NL toddler diet) for rapeseeds and 0.01% of the ADI (GEMS/Food G11 diet) for mustard seeds. No acute consumer intake concerns were identified for flupyradifurone residues in rapeseeds and mustard seeds (individually 0.2% of the ARfD).The consumer exposure to DFA residues in the crops from the soil uptake (scenario 2) as calculated in the previous EFSA output was not updated, since the uptake of DFA (and flupyradifurone) residues in untreated rotational crops was estimated from more critical flupyradifurone EU uses than the intended uses under consideration. The same conclusions are therefore applicable. The calculated consumer exposure accounted for up to 17% of the ADI (GEMS/Food G06 diet). No acute consumer intake concerns were identified for DFA residues in rapeseeds and mustard seeds from the soil uptake (individually < 0.1% of the ARfD).The combined chronic exposure to flupyradifurone and DFA residues from the intake of food commodities following primary crop treatments, from the intake of animal commodities and from the intake of food commodities containing residues due to the uptake via soil accounts for a maximum of 69% of the ADI (NL toddler). No acute consumer intake concerns were identified for a combined acute exposure to flupyradifurone and DFA residues from the intake of rapeseeds and mustard seeds treated as primary crops and when grown in a crop rotation.EFSA concluded that the proposed use of flupyradifurone on oilseed rape and mustard will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a risk to consumers’ health. EFSA concluded that the short‐term and long‐term intake of residues of flupyradifurone and of its metabolite DFA resulting from the use of flupyradifurone is unlikely to present a risk to consumer health.EFSA proposes to amend the existing MRLs as reported in the summary table below.Full details of all end points and the consumer risk assessment can be found in Appendices B–D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodea\n\nCommodity\nExisting EU MRL (mg/kg)\nProposed EU MRL (mg/kg)\nComment/justification\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforcement residue definition (1): Flupyradifurone\n\n\n\n0401060\nRapeseeds/canola seeds\n0.01*\n\n0.3\nThe submitted data are sufficient to derive an MRL proposal for the intended NEU and SEU uses.

The resulting MRL proposal would be 0.4 mg/kg.

The confirmatory data were sufficiently addressed in the recent EFSA assessment proposing the deletion of the footnote (EFSA, 2020).\n\n\n\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) received an application to modify the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for flupyradifurone and its metabolite difluoroacetic acid (DFA) in rapeseeds/canola seeds and mustard seeds. The detailed description of the intended uses of flupyradifurone in NEU and SEU on oilseed rape and mustard, which are the basis for the current MRL application, is reported in Appendix A.Flupyradifurone is the ISO common name for 4‐[(6‐chloro‐3‐pyridylmethyl)(2,2‐difluoroethyl) amino]furan‐2(5H)‐one (IUPAC). The chemical structures of the active substance and its main metabolites are reported in Appendix E.Flupyradifurone was evaluated in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107/20099 with the Netherlands designated as rapporteur Member State (RMS) for the representative uses of foliar applications on hops and lettuce. The Draft Assessment Report (DAR) also included a proposal to set maximum residue levels (MRL application), in accordance with Article 11 (2) of the Regulation (EC) 1107/2009. The draft assessment report (DAR) prepared by the RMS has been peer reviewed by EFSA (EFSA, 2015) where some information was identified as unavailable (data gaps) and tentative MRLs were derived for those uses which were not fully supported by data. Flupyradifurone was approved2 for use as insecticide on 9 December 2015.The MRL proposals for both flupyradifurone and its metabolite difluoroacetic acid (DFA) were implemented in the MRL legislation by Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/4863. The data gaps identified by the peer review as well as residues of flupyradifurone and DFA from new uses and authorised uses in third countries were assessed in a recently issued EFSA reasoned opinion (EFSA, 2020). The MRL proposals have not yet been implemented in the MRL legislation, but the conclusions taken therein will be considered for the present assessment.In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/20054, Bayer SAS ‐ Crop Science Division submitted an application to the competent national authority in the Netherlands (evaluating Member State, EMS) to modify the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for the active substance flupyradifurone and its metabolite difluoroacetic acid (DFA) in rapeseeds/canola seeds and mustard seeds. The EMS drafted an evaluation report in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on 11 December 2019. To accommodate for the intended uses of flupyradifurone, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs for flupyradifurone in rapeseeds and mustard seeds from the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.01 to 0.3 mg/kg and to raise the existing MRLs for DFA in rapeseeds and mustard seeds from the LOQ of 0.05 to 0.3 mg/kg.EFSA based its assessment on the evaluation report submitted by the EMS (Netherlands, 2019), the draft assessment report (DAR) (and its addendum) (Netherlands, 2014, 2015) prepared under Regulation (EC) 1107/2009, the Commission review report on flupyradifurone (European Commission, 2015), the conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance flupyradifurone (EFSA, 2015) as well as the conclusions from previous EFSA opinions on flupyradifurone (EFSA, 2016, 2020).For this application, the data requirements established in Regulation (EU) No 283/20135 and the guidance documents applicable at the date of submission of the application to the EMS are applicable (European Commission, 2000, 2010a,b, 2017; OECD, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, a, b, a, b, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2018). The assessment is performed in accordance with the legal provisions of the Uniform Principles for the Evaluation and the Authorisation of Plant Protection Products adopted by Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/20116.A selected list of end points of the studies assessed by EFSA in the framework of this MRL application including the end points of relevant studies assessed previously, are presented in Appendix B.The evaluation report submitted by the EMS (Netherlands, 2019) and the exposure calculations using the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) are considered as supporting documents to this reasoned opinion and, thus, are made publicly available as background documents to this reasoned opinion.Rapeseed meal can be fed to livestock and therefore the possible carry‐over of flupyradifurone and DFA residues in commodities of animal origin would need to be assessed. The applicant has reported that the intended use pattern is not intended for harvesting forage as feed item (Netherlands, 2019).The previous EU livestock dietary burden calculation for the intake of flupyradifurone and DFA residues from imported feed and the EU feed items (EFSA, 2020) was updated with residue values for rapeseed meal from the new intended uses. When considering the livestock exposure to DFA residues, also the intake of this metabolite via rotational crops has been considered.The livestock exposure was calculated separately for flupyradifurone and the DFA according to the OECD methodology using the EFSA Animal model 2017 (OECD, 2013). For rapeseeds, the input values were as derived from the residue trials under consideration. For remaining feed items, the input values were as reported in Appendix D.1. in the previous EFSA assessment (EFSA, 2020).The results of the dietary burden calculations, which are presented in Appendix B, Section B.2, indicated significant exposure to residues of flupyradifurone and DFA, exceeding the trigger value of 0.004 mg/kg bw per day for all livestock species. Since the contribution of flupyradifurone and DFA residues in rapeseed meal to the total EU livestock dietary burden is insignificant, the magnitude of residues in animal commodities was not further assessed.EFSA concludes that the residues in rapeseeds from the intended uses will not affect the residues in animal commodities as estimated in the previous EFSA assessment.The consumer risk assessment was performed with revision 3.1 of the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo). This exposure assessment model contains the relevant European food consumption data for different subgroups of the EU population (EFSA, 2018, 2019).The toxicological reference values for flupyradifurone used in the risk assessment (i.e. ADI of 0.064 mg/kg bw per day and ARfD of 0.15 mg/kg bw) were derived in the framework of the EU pesticides peer review (European Commission, 2015). The peer review also assessed toxicological studies submitted for metabolite DFA and concluded that the reference values of parent are applicable to DFA (EFSA, 2015). The residue definition for risk assessment refers to the sum of flupyradifurone and DFA, expressed as flupyradifurone.The previous consumer exposure assessment performed in the EFSA opinion on the modification of MRLs for flupyradifurone and DFA (EFSA, 2020) was updated with risk assessment values for rapeseeds and mustard seeds as derived from the submitted residue trials.EFSA performed two separate consumer exposure calculations in order to estimate the exposure from primary crops (including also animal products) and rotational crops, to provide risk managers additional information to decide on risk management options as regards residues in rotational crops, e.g. whether MRLs should be established to cover residues in rotational crops or whether other restrictions would be appropriate to avoid residues in untreated crops. The calculated exposures were then compared with the toxicological reference values as derived for flupyradifurone.Scenario 1: Exposure to residues from treated primary plant commodities and from the intake of animal commoditiesIn order to estimate chronic and acute consumer exposure to residues of flupyradifurone and DFA, the STMR values as derived for rapeseeds and mustard seeds from the submitted residue trials (Table B.1.2.1) were used as input values. For the remaining plant and animal commodities, the input values were as reported in the previous EFSA assessment (EFSA, 2020). For those commodities on which no uses of flupyradifurone are authorised in EU, no input values were used in the consumer exposure calculation.The calculated chronic exposure accounted for a maximum of 54% of the ADI (NL toddler diet). The contribution of residues in rapeseeds and mustard seeds to the total consumer exposure was low: 0.34% of the ADI (NL toddler) for rapeseeds and 0.01% of the ADI (GEMS/Food G11 diet) for mustard seeds.No acute consumer intake concerns were identified for flupyradifurone residues in rapeseeds and mustard seeds (individually 0.2% of the ARfD).Scenario 2: Exposure to residues of DFA (and of flupyradifurone on lettuce and barley) from the intake of plant commodities that are grown as rotational crops (no primary treatment)The exposure assessment as calculated in the previous EFSA output (EFSA, 2020) was not updated, since the uptake of DFA (and flupyradifurone) residues in untreated rotational crops was estimated from more critical flupyradifurone EU uses than the intended uses under consideration. The same conclusions are therefore applicable. The consumer exposure from the chronic intake of DFA residues taken up by crops from the soil which was previously treated with flupyradifurone accounted for up to 17% of the ADI (GEMS/Food G06 diet).The contribution of residues in untreated rapeseeds and mustard seeds from the soil uptake of residues to the acute consumer exposure was individually below 0.1% of the ARfD.An overview of input values for consumer exposure assessment is provided in Appendix D.2. For further details on the exposure calculations, screenshots of the Report sheets of the PRIMo are presented in Appendix C.The combined chronic exposure to flupyradifurone and DFA residues from the intake of food commodities following primary crop treatments, from the intake of animal commodities and from the intake of food commodities containing residues due to the uptake via soil accounts for a maximum of 69% of the ADI (NL toddler diet). No acute consumer intake concerns were identified for a combined acute exposure to flupyradifurone and DFA residues from the intake of rapeseeds and mustard seeds treated as primary crops and when grown in a crop rotation.The data submitted in support of this MRL application were found to be sufficient to derive an MRL proposal for flupyradifurone and DFA in rapeseeds/canola seeds and mustard seeds on the basis of the intended EU uses.EFSA concluded that the proposed uses of flupyradifurone on oilseed rape and mustard will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a risk to consumers’ health. EFSA concluded that the short‐term and long‐term intake of residues of flupyradifurone and of its metabolite DFA resulting from the use of flupyradifurone is unlikely to present a risk to consumer health.The MRL recommendations are summarised in Appendix B.4.\n\n\n\n\na.s.\n\nactive substance\n\n\n\n\nADI\n\nacceptable daily intake\n\n\n\n\nARfD\n\nacute reference dose\n\n\n\n\nBBCH\n\ngrowth stages of mono‐ and dicotyledonous plants\n\n\n\n\nbw\n\nbody weight\n\n\n\n\nCAS\n\nChemical Abstract Service\n\n\n\n\nCF\n\nconversion factor for enforcement to risk assessment residue definition\n\n\n\n\nCS\n\ncapsule suspension\n\n\n\n\nCV\n\ncoefficient of variation (relative standard deviation)\n\n\n\n\nDALA\n\ndays after last application\n\n\n\n\nDAR\n\ndraft assessment report\n\n\n\n\nDAT\n\ndays after treatment\n\n\n\n\nDM\n\ndry matter\n\n\n\n\nDP\n\ndustable powder\n\n\n\n\nDS\n\npowder for dry seed treatment\n\n\n\n\nEC\n\nemulsifiable concentrate\n\n\n\n\nEDI\n\nestimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nEMS\n\nevaluating Member State\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nGS\n\ngrowth stage\n\n\n\n\nHPLC\n\nhigh‐performance liquid chromatography\n\n\n\n\nHPLC‐MS\n\nhigh‐performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nHPLC‐MS/MS\n\nhigh‐performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nHR\n\nhighest residue\n\n\n\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organisation for Standardisation\n\n\n\n\nIUPAC\n\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n\n\n\n\nLC\n\nliquid chromatography\n\n\n\n\nLOQ\n\nlimit of quantification\n\n\n\n\nMRL\n\nmaximum residue level\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nMember States\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nmass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nMS/MS\n\ntandem mass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nMW\n\nmolecular weight\n\n\n\n\nNEU\n\nnorthern Europe\n\n\n\n\nOECD\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development\n\n\n\n\nPBI\n\nplant back interval\n\n\n\n\nPF\n\nprocessing factor\n\n\n\n\nPHI\n\npreharvest interval\n\n\n\n\nRA\n\nrisk assessment\n\n\n\n\nRD\n\nresidue definition\n\n\n\n\nRMS\n\nrapporteur Member State\n\n\n\n\nSC\n\nsuspension concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSL\n\nsoluble concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSP\n\nwater‐soluble powder\n\n\n\n\nSTMR\n\nsupervised trials median residue\n\n\n\n\nTAR\n\ntotal applied radioactivity\n\n\n\n\nTRR\n\ntotal radioactive residue\n\n\n\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n"

        "summary": "This report presents the results of surveillance on transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) in cattle, sheep, goats, cervids and other species, and genotyping in sheep, carried out in 2019 by 28 Member States (MS), and by Iceland, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia and Switzerland (non‐MS). In total, 1,150,388 cattle were tested by MS, a 2.7% decrease from 2018 and 44,557 by the six non‐MS. Six cases of H‐BSE were reported by France (4) and Spain (2), and 1 L‐BSE by Poland. The number of H‐ BSE cases was the largest reported per year including the youngest ever case (5.5 years of age). In total, 338,098 sheep and 143,529 goats were tested in the EU, an increase of 3.9% in both species compared with 2018. In sheep, 17 inconclusive cases by two MS and 997 cases of scrapie were reported: 911 classical (97 index cases (IC), one of ARR/ARR genotype and 98.7% with genotypes of susceptible groups) by seven MS, 86 atypical (AS) (80 IC) by 11 MS. Thirty‐one ovine scrapie cases were reported by Iceland and Norway. Random genotyping was only reported by eight MS: Cyprus excluded, 15.7% of genotyped sheep carried genotypes of susceptible groups. In goats, three inconclusive cases by two MS and 390 cases of scrapie were reported: 379 classical (24 IC) by six MS, 11 atypical (10 IC) by six MS. The heterogeneous enforcement of a 3‐year surveillance programme for chronic wasting disease (CWD) in six MS (Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden) resulted in the testing of 7,980 cervids and confirmation of three CWD cases in wild moose in Sweden. Other seven MS tested 2,732 cervids with no positive results. Norway tested 30,147 cervids in 2019, with two new moose cases. In total, 122 animals from four other species reported by three MS TSE tested negative.",
        "full-text": "This report of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) presents the detailed results of surveillance activities on animal transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) carried out during 2019 in the European Union (EU) and in six non‐Member States (non‐MS), i.e. Iceland, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia and Switzerland, as well as genotyping data in sheep. TSE monitoring data for cattle, sheep, goats, cervids and species other than domestic ruminants are reported by country according to Regulation (EC) 999/2001 (the TSE Regulation) and consist of testing data as well as case data.Surveillance data were mainly submitted through the EFSA TSE data reporting tool. Six MS submitted data directly as eXtensible Markup Language (XML) files by using their own system for the automatic upload of data into the EFSA Data Collection Framework (DCF) whereas the rest of the reporting countries submitted XML files via the EFSA TSE data collection tool. The electronically submitted data were extracted from the EFSA database and further processed and validated by EFSA to summarise the information and to elaborate the summary tables presented in the current EU summary report (EUSR).A descriptive summary of the reported data is provided at reporting country level or aggregated at EU level for all reporting countries. When possible, descriptions and calculations were stratified according to the available variables, such as surveillance target group (healthy slaughtered animals, animals culled under bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)/TSE control and eradication measures, etc.) or surveillance type (passive vs. active), country, sampling year (since 2001 for bovine animals and 2002 for small ruminants), case type (i.e. classical BSE (C‐BSE), atypical BSE (H‐BSE or L‐BSE), classical scrapie (CS) or atypical scrapie (AS)), flock/herd status (infected/non‐infected), index case and age class.In total, 1,150,388 cattle were tested in 2019 in the EU. BSE testing was concentrated in the group of risk animals (emergency slaughtered animals (ES), animals with clinical signs at ante mortem inspection (AM) and fallen stock (FS)) with over 83% of all cattle tested in the EU, with FS being the largest contributor with 918,182 cattle tested in 2019 (92.4% of all cattle in the risk group). An additional 44,557 cattle were tested by four of the six non‐MS, with no cases reported. Serbia (the main contributor with 20,110 cattle tested) and Montenegro and reported mostly cattle from the HS target group.Seven atypical cases of BSE were confirmed in 2019 by: Spain (2 H‐BSE), France (4 H‐BSE) and Poland (1 L‐BSE), all born between 2001 and 2008 except one H‐type case of 5.5 years in Spain. From an epidemiological point of view, the highlights in the BSE caseload of the reporting year are: the number of H‐type BSE cases was the largest reported in a single year, equal to that of 2009 (6), (six cases per million tested) and the report by Spain of a H‐type case of 5.5 years, the youngest atypical BSE ever reported since the TSE data are collected and published. An additional H‐BSE case was reported by Brazil.In total, 481,627 small ruminants were tested in 2019 in the EU: 338,098 sheep (3.9% increase from 2018) and 143,529 goats (3.9% increase). In addition, 23,473 sheep and 217 goats were tested by four and three of the six non‐MS, respectively.In sheep, 997 scrapie cases were reported in the EU in 2019, 641 more case than in 2018. A total 31 cases of scrapie in sheep were reported by two (Iceland and Norway) of the four non‐MS that tested in total 23,473 sheep, namely, Iceland, North Macedonia, Norway and Serbia. Classical scrapie (CS) was reported by seven MS and one non‐MS: Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Spain, the United Kingdom and Iceland, whereas atypical scrapie (AS) was reported by 11 MS and one non‐MS: Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, the United Kingdom and Norway. An additional total of 17 cases in sheep were reported as inconclusive by Spain (5) and Italy (12) (See Table 31), which are not included in the total scrapie caseloads for these two countries.Most of the ovine cases (91.7%) were reported by four countries, namely Greece, Italy, Romania and Spain, as it was the case in the previous year. In total, 911 ovine cases in the EU were CS (91.4%) and 86 were AS (8.6%). Among the non‐MS, 21 CS cases were reported by Iceland and 10 AS cases by Norway. In sheep, 17.8% (177) of all cases in the EU reported in 2019 were index cases, with a much higher proportion in AS cases (80/86: 93%) compared to CS cases (97/911: 10.6%). In total, 98.7% of the CS cases in sheep reported in 2019 with known genotypes belonged to animals holding genotypes of the susceptible groups (NSP3, NSP3O, NSP4 or NSP5). One CS case was reported by Spain in a sheep carrying the ARR/ARR genotype, a very rare occurrence.In goats, 390 scrapie cases were reported in the EU in 2019, which is a reduction of 25.4% (–133) compared with 2018 when 523 cases were reported. Out of 390 caprine scrapie cases, 379 were CS (97.2%, with Cyprus accounting for 81.3% of these) and 11 were AS. This reduction is mainly due to the decrease in the number of cases in goats in two reporting countries: Cyprus (from 382 to 309), Spain (from 91 to 37). CS was reported by six MS, namely Cyprus, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. AS was also reported by six MS: Cyprus, France, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Spain. The 217 goats tested by three non‐MS (Iceland, North Macedonia and Norway) were all negative. An additional total of three cases in goats were reported as inconclusive by Spain (1) and Italy (2) (See Table 33), which are not included in the total scrapie caseloads for these two countries.In goats, only 8.7% of all cases reported in the EU in 2019 were index cases, lower than in 2018 (9.6%), with a higher proportion in AS (10/11: 90.9%) than in CS (24/379: 6.3%). Currently, CS is still the most frequently reported type of scrapie in the EU in both species. Focusing on the last 10 years (2010–2019), in sheep, there has been a significant average decrease of, respectively, 5% per year in CS and 4% per year in AS. In goats, there was no detectable trend for both CS and AS.The long‐term trends of CS in terms of cases per 10,000 tests in both species, the situation in 2019 confirmed the 10‐year statistically significant decreasing trend in sheep and no detectable trend in goats, respectively. With regard to the long‐term trends of AS, there was also a 10‐year statistically significant decreasing trend in sheep and no detectable trend in goats.In 2019, the genotyping activity from random samples of the national EU sheep populations was carried out by eight MS: Belgium, Cyprus (where genotyping is conducted systematically in the breeding sheep population), France, Greece, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands and Poland. After excluding Cyprus, 15.7% of the randomly genotyped sheep still carried genotypes of the susceptible groups, lower than the 19.2% in 2018. The percentage of susceptible sheep rose to 45.5% in Greece and 29.9% in Italy, two of the countries with the highest caseload in 2019, whereas the percentage was 10.3% in the other five MS.The enforcement of a 3‐year surveillance programme for CWD in six MS – Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden – resulted in the testing of 7,980 cervids and the confirmation of three cases of CWD in wild moose by Sweden. The implementation of the mandatory surveillance in the six MS is quite heterogeneous in terms of design (number and characteristics of the declared primary sampling units, PSU), number of cervids tested in general and per PSU and distribution of testing by species and target groups. The targeting of mostly hunted/slaughtered fit for human consumption (HSHC) animals observed in the first year of implementation was increased in 2019 up to 60.5% of all tested cervids, consolidating a situation in which the sensitivity of the surveillance system is lower than expected. Other seven MS – Austria, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom – tested 2,732 cervids, all with negative results and with Romania accounting for 77,7% of all cervids tested by them. Norway continued its intensified testing programme in wild and captive cervids and tested 30,147 animals in 2019, mostly semi‐domesticated reindeer (42.9%), followed by wild moose (19.7%) and red deer (17.2%), leading to the detection of two moose cases. Additionally, Iceland reported testing of 114 cervids, with no cases.A total of 122 animals of other species were TSE tested by Finland (114), Estonia (6) and Spain (2): 12 raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), 66 American minks (Neovison vison), 42 foxes (genus Vulpes) and 2 chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra). None of them tested positive.As part of the BSE surveillance system in cattle in the EU, over 1.1 million cattle were tested in 2019, 2.7% less than in the previous year. The testing throughput combined with a risk‐based strategy (86.4% of all tests were targeting risk animals) contributed to maximise the sensitivity of the BSE surveillance system considering the EU as a single epidemiological unit. Seven atypical cases of BSE (one L‐BSE and six H‐BSE cases) were confirmed in 2019 by three reporting countries: France (four H‐BSE), Spain (two H‐BSE) and Poland (one L‐BSE). A total 44,557 cattle were tested by four of the six non‐MS reporting countries, with no cases reported. In particular, in the two new reporting countries, Montenegro only tested cattle in the target group slaughter for human consumption and in Serbia, 85.7% cattle were tested in the same target group.From an epidemiological point of view, the highlights in the BSE caseload of the reporting year are the number of H‐type BSE cases was the largest reported in a single year, equal to that of 2009 (6) (six cases per million tested) and the report by Spain of a H‐type case of 5.5 years, the youngest atypical BSE ever reported since the TSE data are collected and published. An additional H‐BSE case was reported by Brazil.A total of 481,627 small ruminants were tested in 2019 in the EU, as part of the TSE surveillance system, leading to an overall testing of about 10 million tests since 2002. Twenty‐two MS complied with the EU monitoring requirements in sheep and 23 MS in goats. Compared with 2018, there was a decrease in the detection of the scrapie cases (CS and AS) in non‐infected sheep flocks (from 203 to 177) despite the 3% increase in the level of testing in non‐infected flocks. This may be consistent with a decrease in the overall incidence of the disease. In the same period, there was a similar decrease in the detection of the scrapie cases (CS and AS) in non‐infected goat herds (from 50 to 34), despite the 3.3% increase in the testing in non TSE‐infected herds, due to the low number of index cases reported by Cyprus (8). Out of the two new reporting countries, only Serbia tested small ruminants: 165 sheep slaughtered for human consumption without any case detected.For CS in sheep, compared with 2018, the increase in the testing activity has resulted in an increase in the EU caseload but not in the proportion of cases per 10,000 tested animals or in the number of index cases, which were reduced again in 2019. Overall, the three countries with the largest number of CS cases, namely Greece, Italy and Spain, have reported more CS cases compared to 2018 but similar number of index cases and increased testing in TSE‐infected flocks, where most of the CS cases are detected. Romania reported 30% fewer number of cases with the same level of testing than in 2018. From a geographical point of view, the disease is reported by a minority of the MS: seven in 2019, same number as in 2018 although some countries differ. As in 2018, only a very small proportion (1.2%) of the CS caseload is from MS other than Greece, Spain, Italy and Romania.In goats, in total, 390 scrapie cases in goats were reported in the EU in 2019 by nine MS (two more than in 2018), with a 25.4% reduction (–133) compared with 2018 when 523 cases were reported, mainly due to the improved situation in Cyprus and Spain.When looking at the long‐term trends of CS in terms of cases per 10,000 tests in both species, the situation in 2019 confirmed the 10‐year statistically significant decreasing trend in sheep and no detectable trend in goats, respectively, as estimated through modelling of the available epidemiological data. The disadvantage of the control of the disease in goat herds, due to the lack of both breeding for resistance programmes and genetic‐based culling and restocking of infected herds, may explain to a certain extent this long‐term trend. However, forthcoming amendments in the TSE regulation per Regulation (EU) 772/2020 will allow the management of outbreaks in goat herds with caprine animals carrying at least one of the following alleles: K222, D146 and S146.For AS in sheep, compared with 2018, the above‐described testing activity resulted in a decrease in the caseload and in the proportion of cases per 10,000 tested animals, a decrease in the number of index cases and the number of MS reporting cases, despite the overall increase in testing. The opposite occurred in goats where the increase in the testing activity compared with 2018 resulted in the increase of the AS caseload, in the proportion of cases per 10,000 tested animals and in the number of index cases. These changes could be due to the annual variability.With regard to the long‐term trends of AS, there was also a 10‐year statistically significant decreasing trend in sheep and no detectable trend in goats.The genotyping data collected in 2019 from ovine CS cases consistently confirm the association between the occurrence of the disease and the susceptible genotypes (NSP3, NSP3O, NSP4 or NSP5), with 98.7% of the cases with known genotypes carrying them. The 2019 genotyping data from random samples of the EU sheep population (after excluding Cyprus) did show an improvement compared with the previous years with an average 15.7% of the genotyped sheep carrying genotypes of the susceptible group, from 19.2% in 2018. Some caution is needed in interpreting this result as it could reflect the implementation of the amendment of the TSE Regulation with the subsequent reduction in the number of contributing MS. A CS case in a sheep holding the ARR/ARR genotype (NSP1) was reported by Spain.The enforcement of the 3‐year surveillance programme for CWD in six MS – Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden – resulted in 2019 in an increase of over 50% the number of cervids tested compared to the previous year: from 5,110 to the testing of 7,980 cervids and the confirmation of three cases of CWD by Sweden.The surveillance was complemented by the additional 2,732 cervids tested by other six MS (77.7% of them tested by Romania) with no additional cases detected. The implementation of the mandatory surveillance in the six MS is quite heterogeneous in terms of the design (number and characteristics of the declared PSU), the number of cervids tested in general and per PSU in particular and the distribution of testing by species and target groups. The targeting of mostly hunted/slaughtered fit for human consumption (HSHC) animals observed in the first year of implementation was further increased in 2019 up to 60.5% of all tested cervids, consolidating a situation in which the sensitivity of the surveillance system is lower than expected, following the proposed surveillance system by EFSA in 2017 (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2017b). No conclusions can be drawn about the presence of the disease in other MS and about the prevalence in the affected MS.Norway continued its intensified testing programme in wild and captive cervids and tested 30,147 cervids in 2019, leading to the detection of two moose cases. At the end of the reporting year and since 2016, Norway had confirmed in total 19 cases in reindeer, 6 in moose and 1 in red deer. Iceland also reported 114 tested cervids in 2019, all negative.\n\n\n\n\nAM\n\n\nAnte‐mortem\n\n\n\n\n\nAS\n\nAtypical scrapie\n\n\n\n\nBARB\n\nBorn After the Revised feed Ban\n\n\n\n\nBSE\n\nBovine spongiform encephalopathy\n\n\n\n\nC–BSE\n\nClassical bovine spongiform encephalopathy\n\n\n\n\nCS\n\nClassical scrapie\n\n\n\n\nDCF\n\nData Collection Framework\n\n\n\n\nDWH\n\nData Warehouse\n\n\n\n\nEFTA\n\nEuropean Free Trade Association\n\n\n\n\nEM\n\nEradication measures\n\n\n\n\nES\n\nEmergency slaughtered\n\n\n\n\nEUSR\n\nEuropean Union summary report\n\n\n\n\nFS\n\nFallen stock\n\n\n\n\nH–BSE\n\nH‐type bovine spongiform encephalopathy\n\n\n\n\nHS\n\nHealthy slaughtered\n\n\n\n\nHSHC\n\nHunted/slaughtered fit for human consumption\n\n\n\n\nHSNHC\n\nHunted/slaughtered not fit for human consumption\n\n\n\n\nL–BSE\n\nL‐type bovine spongiform encephalopathy\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nMember State/s\n\n\n\n\nMS6\n\nEstonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden\n\n\n\n\nNSHC\n\nNot slaughtered for human consumption\n\n\n\n\nNSP\n\nNational Scrapie Plan\n\n\n\n\nPSU\n\nPrimary sampling units\n\n\n\n\nRK\n\nRoad/predator killed\n\n\n\n\nRR\n\nRelative risk\n\n\n\n\nSHC\n\nSlaughtered for human consumption\n\n\n\n\nSU\n\nclinical suspect\n\n\n\n\nSUS\n\nclinical suspect (cervids)\n\n\n\n\nTSE\n\nTransmissible spongiform encephalopathies\n\n\n\n\nWB\n\nWestern blot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustria\nAT\nFrance\nFR\nLuxembourg\nLU\nSerbia\nRS\n\n\n\n\nBelgium\nBE\nGermany\nDE\nMalta\nMT\nSlovakia\nSK\n\n\nBulgaria\nBG\nGreece\nEL\nMontenegro\nME\nSlovenia\nSI\n\n\nCroatia\nHR\nHungary\nHU\nThe Netherlands\nNL\nSpain\nES\n\n\nCyprus\nCY\nIceland\nIS\nNorth Macedonia\nMK\nSweden\nSE\n\n\nCzechia\nCZ\nIreland\nIE\nNorway\nNO\nSwitzerland\nCH\n\n\nDenmark\nDK\nItaly\nIT\nPoland\nPL\nThe United Kingdom\nUK\n\n\nEstonia\nEE\nLatvia\nLV\nPortugal\nPT\n\n\n\n\nFinland\nFI\nLithuania\nLT\nRomania\nRO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMS countries: AT; BE; BG; HR; CY; CZ; DK; EE; FI; FR; DE; EL; HU; IE; IT; LV; LT; LU; MT; NL; PL; PT; RO; SK; SI; ES; SE; UK.Non‐MS countries: CH (including Lichtenstein); IS; ME; MK; NO; RS."

        "full-text": "Article 3 of the Regulation (EC) No 1332/20081 provides definition for ‘food enzyme’ and ‘food enzyme preparation’.‘Food enzyme’ means a product obtained from plants, animals or microorganisms or products thereof including a product obtained by a fermentation process using microorganisms: (i) containing one or more enzymes capable of catalysing a specific biochemical reaction; and (ii) added to food for a technological purpose at any stage of the manufacturing, processing, preparation, treatment, packaging, transport or storage of foods.‘Food enzyme preparation’ means a formulation consisting of one or more food enzymes in which substances such as food additives and/or other food ingredients are incorporated to facilitate their storage, sale, standardisation, dilution or dissolution.Before January 2009, food enzymes other than those used as food additives were not regulated or were regulated as processing aids under the legislation of the Member States. On 20 January 2009, Regulation (EC) No 1332/2008 on food enzymes came into force. This Regulation applies to enzymes that are added to food to perform a technological function in the manufacture, processing, preparation, treatment, packaging, transport or storage of such food, including enzymes used as processing aids.

        "summary": "Since 16 October 2020, outbreaks ofhighly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruseshavebeen reported inseveral EU/EEAcountries –Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Swedenas well asin the United Kingdom.As of 19 November,12pm, 302 HPAI A(H5) detections have been reported, with the majority of the detections referring to wild birds (n=281), and a few related to outbreaks in poultry (n=18) and captive birds (n=3). Most of the detections in wild birds were in wild waterbirds,being barnacle goose the most affected species (n=110), followed by greylag goose (n=47), Eurasian wigeon (n=32),mallard (n=14), and common buzzard (n=13).ThreeHPAI virus subtypes were identified, A(H5N8), A(H5N5) and A(H5N1), with A(H5N8) being the most reported subtype (n=284). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the viruses evolved from a single progenitor virus thatwent through multiple reassortment events. Based on the ongoing autumn migration of wild waterbirds to their wintering areas in Europe, there is a continued risk of further introduction of HPAI A(H5) viruses into Europe. Furthermore, given the expected movements of both migratory, and resident wild birds in Europe during winter, there is a high risk of further spread of HPAI A(H5) viruses within Europe. No genetic markers indicating adaptation to mammals have been identified in the viruses analysed so far,andno human infection due to avian influenza viruses detected in the recent outbreakshas been reported. For that reason,the risk to the general population remains very low.However,following the precautionary principle, people should avoid touching sick or dead birds unprotected to minimise any potential risk.",

        "full-text": "In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, BASF SE submitted an application to the competent national authority in the United Kingdom (evaluating Member State (EMS)) to set import tolerances for the active substance fluxapyroxad in various crops. The EMS drafted an evaluation report in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on 20 June 2019. The EMS proposed to establish maximum residue levels (MRLs) for coffee beans imported from Brazil at the level of 0.15 mg/kg and for the crops belonging to the group of other root and tuber vegetables (except sugar beets) imported from the United States at 0.9 mg/kg.EFSA assessed the application and the evaluation report as required by Article 10 of the MRL regulation.Based on the conclusions derived by EFSA in the framework of Directive 91/414/EEC, the data evaluated under previous MRL assessments and the additional data provided by the EMS in the framework of this application, the following conclusions are derived.The metabolism of fluxapyroxad following foliar applications was investigated in crops belonging to the groups of fruit crops, cereals/grass and pulses/oilseeds and following seed treatment in cereals. On rotational crops, metabolism was investigated in root/tuber, leafy and cereal crops after bare soil application. Studies investigating the effect of processing on the nature of fluxapyroxad (hydrolysis studies) demonstrated that the active substance is stable. Based on the metabolic pattern identified in metabolism studies, hydrolysis studies and the toxicological significance of metabolites, the European Union (EU) pesticides peer review agreed on a residue definition for plant products as ‘fluxapyroxad’ for enforcement and risk assessment. These residue definitions are applicable to primary crops, rotational crops and processed products.EFSA concluded that for the crops assessed in this application, the metabolism of fluxapyroxad in primary and in rotational crops, and the possible degradation in processed products has been sufficiently addressed and that the previously derived residue definitions are applicable.Sufficiently validated analytical methods based on liquid chromatography are available to quantify residues in the crops assessed in this application according to the enforcement residue definition. The methods enable quantification of residues at or above 0.01 mg/kg (limit of quantification (LOQ)) in the crops assessed.The available residue trials are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 0.9 mg/kg for the crops belonging to the group of other root and tuber vegetables (except sugar beets) (crop code 0213000) by extrapolation from residue trials in carrots. For radishes, sufficient residue trials are available to derive an MRL proposal, which is lower than the existing EU MRL. For Jerusalem artichokes, the MRL derived by extrapolation from data on carrots (0.9 mg/kg) is significantly higher than the MRL set in the country of origin (0.02 mg/kg). For coffee beans, a risk management decision needs to be taken between the two possible MRL options: 0.2 mg/kg as established in the country of origin or 0.3 mg/kg derived using the OECD calculator tool.As the proposed uses of fluxapyroxad are on imported crops, investigations of residues in rotational crops are not required. However, fluxapyroxad exhibited high persistence in soil and the possibility of residues of fluxapyroxad to be present in rotational crops cannot be excluded.Although some of the crops under assessment (carrots, swedes and turnips) and their by‐products are used as feed products, a modification of the existing MRLs for commodities of animal origin was considered unnecessary.The toxicological profile of fluxapyroxad was assessed in the framework of the EU pesticides peer review and the data were sufficient to derive an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0.02 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day and an acute reference dose (ARfD) of 0.25 mg/kg bw. The metabolite included in the residue definition for risk assessment in products of animal origin was concluded to be of similar toxicity as the parent active substance.The consumer risk assessment was performed with revision 2 of the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo). No concerns from long‐term exposure to fluxapyroxad were identified for any of the European diets incorporated in the EFSA PRIMo. The estimated long‐term dietary intake of fluxapyroxad was in the range of 6–37% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI). The contribution of residues in the root and tuber vegetables and coffee beans under assessment to the total consumer exposure was low. Regarding the risk assessment for the short‐term consumption of the crops under assessment, the acute exposure did not identify any concerns for human health.EFSA concluded that the proposed use of fluxapyroxad on other root and tuber vegetables, except sugar beets, and coffee will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values set for fluxapyroxad and therefore is unlikely to pose a risk to consumers’ health.The review of the existing MRLs under Article 12 of Regulation 396/2005 is not yet finalised; therefore, the conclusions reported in this reasoned opinion may need to be reconsidered in the light of the outcome of the MRL review.EFSA proposes to amend the existing MRLs as reported in the summary table below.Full details of all endpoints and the consumer risk assessment can be found in Appendices B–D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodea\nCommodity\nExisting EU MRL (mg/kg)\nProposed EU MRL (mg/kg)\nComment/justification\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforcement residue definition: Fluxapyroxad(F)\n\n\n213010\nBeetroots\n0.3\n0.9\n\nThe requested import tolerance (USA) is sufficiently supported by data (extrapolation from residue data on carrots).

The detailed description of the notified uses of fluxapyroxad in Brazil for coffee beans and in the United States for the group of other root and tuber vegetables (except sugar beets), which are the basis for the current maximum residue level (MRL) application, is reported in Appendix A.Fluxapyroxad is the ISO common name for 3‐(difluoromethyl)‐1‐methyl‐2′‐(3,4,5‐trifluorophenyl)‐1H‐pyrazole‐4‐carboxanilide (IUPAC). The chemical structures of the active substance and its main metabolite are reported in Appendix E.Fluxapyroxad is an active substance approved in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/20091 by Regulation (EU) No 589/20122 which entered into force on 1 January 2013. It is approved for use as a fungicide. The representative uses evaluated in the EU pesticides peer review were spray applications on cereals. The Draft Assessment Report (DAR) of fluxapyroxad has been peer reviewed by EFSA.The EU MRLs for fluxapyroxad are established in Annex III of Regulation (EC) No 396/20053. The review of existing MRLs according to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 (MRL review) is currently on going. EFSA has issued several reasoned opinions on the modification of MRLs for fluxapyroxad (EFSA, 2011, 2015, 2016, 2017). The proposals from these EFSA opinions have been considered in the EU MRL legislation4; the last modification of the MRLs has been introduced by Regulation (EU) 2018/6855. In addition, certain Codex MRLs have been taken over in the EU legislation.In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, BASF SE submitted the application to the competent national authority in the United Kingdom (evaluating Member State (EMS)) on 24 March 2017 to set import tolerances for the active substance fluxapyroxad in certain root crops and in coffee beans. The EMS drafted an evaluation report in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA on 20 June 2019. The EMS proposed to establish MRLs for coffee beans imported from Brazil at the level of 0.15 mg/kg and for the crops belonging to the group of other root and tuber vegetables (except sugar beets) imported from the USA at 0.9 mg/kg.EFSA based its assessment on the evaluation report submitted by the EMS (United Kingdom, 2019), the DAR and its final addendum prepared under Directive 91/414/EEC (United Kingdom, 2011a,b), the Commission review report on fluxapyroxad (European Commission, 2012), the conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fluxapyroxad (EFSA, 2012), the JMPR reports (FAO, 2012, 2015, 2018) as well as the conclusions from previous EFSA opinions on fluxapyroxad (EFSA, 2011, 2015, 2016, 2017) and scientific reports (EFSA, 2013, 2019).For this application, the data requirements established in Regulation (EU) No 544/20116 and the guidance documents applicable at the date of submission of the application to the EMS are applicable (European Commission, 1997a–g, 2000, 2010a,b, 2017; OECD, 2011, 2013). The assessment is performed in accordance with the legal provisions of the Uniform Principles for the Evaluation and the Authorisation of Plant Protection Products adopted by Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/20117.As the review of the existing MRLs under Article 12 of Regulation 396/2005 is not yet finalised, the conclusions reported in this reasoned opinion may need to be reconsidered in the light of the outcome of the MRL review.A selected list of end points of the studies assessed by EFSA in the framework of this MRL application including the end points of relevant studies assessed previously, is presented in Appendix B.The evaluation report submitted by the EMS (United Kingdom, 2019) and the exposure calculations using the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) are considered as supporting documents to this reasoned opinion and, thus, are made publicly available as background documents to this reasoned opinion.EFSA updated the most recent livestock dietary burden calculation (EFSA, 2017), including the residues in the crop under consideration in this MRL application. The results of the updated dietary burden are reported in Section B.2 and the details on the input values are presented in Appendix D.2.The existing EU MRLs for commodities of animal origin are based on CXLs that have been taken over in EU legislation in 2017.9 Considering that the dietary burden calculated by JMPR in 2015 and 2018 when additional CXLs for feed items were derived, was higher than the calculated EU dietary burden (FAO, 2015, 2018), EFSA concluded that a modification of the existing MRLs in products of animal origin is not required.The consumer risk assessment was performed with revision 2 of the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo). This exposure assessment model contains the relevant European food consumption data for different sub‐groups of the EU population (EFSA, 2007).The toxicological profile of fluxapyroxad was assessed in the framework of the EU pesticides peer review and the data were sufficient to derive an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0.02 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day and an ARfD of 0.25 mg/kg bw (European Commission, 2012).For the calculation of the chronic exposure to fluxapyroxad, EFSA updated the most recent risk assessment (EFSA, 2017) for the root and tuber vegetables under assessments and for coffee beans with the supervised trials median residue (STMR) values derived from residue trials in carrots and coffee beans. For radishes, the most critical STMR derived by extrapolation from carrots, instead of the STMR derived from the residue trials on this crop was used for a conservative approach. For tropical root and tuber vegetables and potatoes, the default MRL of 0.1 mg/kg which reflects residues expected in rotational crop was used for the calculation. The STMRs for the Codex MRLs recently adopted by CAC which were supported by the EU were also included in the calculation (FAO, 2018; EFSA, 2019).The acute risk assessment was performed only for the crops under assessment using the highest residue derived from the residue trials on carrots and on coffee beans.The details on the input values are presented in Appendix D.2.No concerns from long‐term exposure to fluxapyroxad were identified for any of the European diets incorporated in the EFSA PRIMo. The estimated long‐term dietary intake of fluxapyroxad was in the range of 6–37% of the ADI (DE child diet). The contribution of the root and tuber crops under assessment accounted for up to 1.19% of the ADI (carrots); for coffee beans the exposure accounted for up to 0.05% of the ADI.Regarding the risk assessment for the short‐term consumption of the crops under assessment, the acute exposure did not identify any concerns for human health (highest exposure is calculated for carrots (15.2% of ARfD)).For further details on the exposure calculations, a screenshot of the Report sheet of the PRIMo is presented in Appendix C.The data submitted were found to be sufficient to derive an MRL proposal of 0.9 mg/kg for beetroots, carrots, celeriac, horseradish, parsnip, parsley root, salsify, swedes/rutabaga and turnips imported from the USA. For radishes, the existing MRL of 0.3 mg/kg covers the US use for which an MRL proposal of 0.2 mg/kg was derived. The US MRL for all these crops is established at the level of 0.9 mg/kg; the same residue definition applies in the USA.For Jerusalem artichokes EFSA derived an MRL proposal of 0.9 mg/kg by extrapolation from carrots. Further risk manager considerations are required, whether the MRL should be raised, taking into account that the US MRL for this crop is set at the level of 0.02 mg/kg.The data submitted were also found to be sufficient to derive an MRL proposal of 0.3 mg/kg for coffee beans imported from Brazil. The proposed MRL is higher than the values set in the country of origin (0.2 mg/kg). Risk management considerations are required, whether the MRL should be established at the level calculated with the OECD calculator (0.3 mg/kg) or at the level of the MRL in the country of origin (0.2 mg/kg), taking into account that the recently adopted Codex MRL will be established at the level of 0.15 mg/kg.EFSA concluded that the short‐term and long‐term intake of residues resulting from the use of fluxapyroxad according to the reported agricultural practices is unlikely to present a risk to consumer health.The MRL recommendations are summarised in Appendix B.4.\n\n\n\n\na.s.\n\nactive substance\n\n\n\n\nADI\n\nacceptable daily intake\n\n\n\n\nARfD\n\nacute reference dose\n\n\n\n\nBBCH\n\ngrowth stages of mono‐ and dicotyledonous plants\n\n\n\n\nbw\n\nbody weight\n\n\n\n\nCAC\n\nCodex Alimentarius Commission\n\n\n\n\nCCPR\n\nCodex Committee on Pesticide Residues\n\n\n\n\nCF\n\nconversion factor for enforcement to risk assessment residue definition\n\n\n\n\nCXL\n\nCodex maximum residue limit\n\n\n\n\nDAR\n\ndraft assessment report\n\n\n\n\nDAT\n\ndays after treatment\n\n\n\n\nDM\n\ndry matter\n\n\n\n\nEC\n\nemulsifiable concentrate\n\n\n\n\nEMS\n\nevaluating Member State\n\n\n\n\nFAO\n\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nHPLC–MS/MS\n\nhigh‐performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nHR\n\nhighest residue\n\n\n\n\nIEDI\n\ninternational estimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nIESTI\n\ninternational estimated short‐term intake\n\n\n\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organisation for Standardisation\n\n\n\n\nIUPAC\n\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n\n\n\n\nJMPR\n\nJoint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues\n\n\n\n\nLOQ\n\nlimit of quantification\n\n\n\n\nMRL\n\nmaximum residue level\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nMember States\n\n\n\n\nNEU\n\nnorthern Europe\n\n\n\n\nOECD\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development\n\n\n\n\nPBI\n\nplant‐back interval\n\n\n\n\nPF\n\nprocessing factor\n\n\n\n\nPHI\n\npreharvest interval\n\n\n\n\nPRIMo\n\n(EFSA) Pesticide Residues Intake Model\n\n\n\n\nRA\n\nrisk assessment\n\n\n\n\nRD\n\nresidue definition\n\n\n\n\nSANCO\n\nDirectorate‐General for Health and Consumers\n\n\n\n\nSEU\n\nsouthern Europe\n\n\n\n\nSTMR\n\nsupervised trials median residue\n\n\n\n\nTMDI\n\ntheoretical maximum daily intake\n\n\n\n\nTRR\n\ntotal radioactive residue\n\n\n\n\nUPLC–MS/MS\n\nultra‐performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n"

        "summary": "According to Article 12 of Regulation ( ) No 396/2005,   has reviewed the maximum residue levels ( s) currently established at European level for the pesticide active substance thiencarbazone‐methyl. To assess the occurrence of thiencarbazone‐methyl residues in plants, processed commodities, rotational crops and livestock,   considered the conclusions derived in the framework of Commission Regulation ( ) No 188/2011 as well as the European authorisations reported by Member States (including the supporting residues data). Based on the assessment of the available data,   proposals were derived and a consumer risk assessment was carried out. All information required by the regulatory framework was present and a risk to consumers was not identified.",
        "full-text": "Thiencarbazone‐methyl was approved on 1 July 2014 by means of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 145/2014 in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as amended by Commission Implementing Regulations (EU) No 540/2011 and 541/2011.As the active substance was approved after the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 on 2 September 2008, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to provide a reasoned opinion on the review of the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for that active substance in compliance with Article 12(1) of the aforementioned regulation.As the basis for the MRL review, on 19 November 2018, EFSA initiated the collection of data for this active substance. In a first step, Member States were invited to submit by 19 December 2018 their national Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) in a standardised way, in the format of specific GAP forms, allowing the rapporteur Member State (RMS) France to identify the critical GAPs in the format of a specific GAP overview file. Subsequently, Member States were requested to provide residue data supporting the critical GAPs, within a period of 1 month, by 28 February 2019. On the basis of all the data submitted by Member States and by the EU Reference Laboratories for Pesticides Residues (EURLs), EFSA asked the RMS to complete the Pesticide Residues Overview File (PROFile) and to prepare a supporting evaluation report. The PROFile and evaluation report, together with Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) calculations and updated GAP overview file were provided by the RMS to EFSA on 29 April 2019. Subsequently, EFSA performed the completeness check of these documents with the RMS. The outcome of this exercise including the clarifications provided by the RMS, if any, was compiled in the completeness check report.Based on the information provided by the RMS, Member States and the EURLs, and taking into account the conclusions derived by EFSA in the framework of Commission Regulation (EU) No 188/2011, EFSA prepared in September 2019 a draft reasoned opinion, which was circulated to Member States and EURLs for consultation via a written procedure. Comments received by 17 October 2019 were considered during the finalisation of this reasoned opinion. The following conclusions are derived.The metabolism of thiencarbazone‐methyl in plants was investigated in primary and rotational crops. According to the results of the metabolism studies on cereals and root and tuber vegetables, the residue definition for enforcement can be proposed as parent thiencarbazone‐methyl only. For risk assessment, the residue definition is proposed as the sum of thiencarbazone‐methyl, BYH 18636‐N‐desmethyl and BYH 18636‐MMT‐glucoside, expressed as thiencarbazone‐methyl. These residue definitions are also applicable to rotational crops. For the current authorised uses, a residue definition is not needed for processed commodities.Fully validated analytical methods are available for the enforcement of the proposed residue definition in cereals and root and tuber vegetables at the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.01 mg/kg. According to the EURLs, the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg is achievable by using the QuEChERS method in routine analyses. All compounds included in the risk assessment residue definition were demonstrated to be stable for at least 26 months in the relevant plant matrices.No residues above the LOQ were found in edible parts from rotational crops. However, a field rotational crop study performed at an exaggerated dose, covering the plateau concentration calculated for the persistent metabolite BYH 18636‐carboxylic acid, is still required to confirm that no significant residues of thiencarbazone‐methyl are expected following multiannual applications according to the most critical GAP assessed in this review.Available residue trials data were considered sufficient to derive MRL proposals as well as risk assessment values for all commodities under evaluation. Specific MRLs for rotational crops are not needed, provided that Member States will take adequate risk mitigation measures in order to avoid significant residues to occur in rotational crops.Thiencarbazone‐methyl is authorised for use on crops that might be fed to livestock. Livestock dietary burden calculations were therefore performed for different groups of livestock according to OECD guidance. The dietary burdens calculated were found to be below the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg dry matter for each group and further investigation of residues as well as the setting of MRLs in commodities of animal origin is not necessary. Nevertheless, the metabolism of thiencarbazone‐methyl residues in livestock was investigated and a general residue definition for enforcement and risk assessment was proposed as thiencarbazone‐methyl and BYH 18636‐MMT, expressed as thiencarbazone‐methyl. Considering the authorised uses reported, a residue definition for livestock commodities is not required in the framework of this review. However, these residue definitions would be considered valid if in the future dietary burdens were to be triggered.An analytical method for the enforcement of the proposed residue definition at the combined LOQ of 0.04 mg/kg in all animal matrices is available. According to the EURLs the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg for each compound individually, is achievable by using the QuEChERS method in routine analyses.Chronic consumer exposure resulting from the authorised uses reported in the framework of this review was calculated using revision 3 of the EFSA PRIMo. The highest chronic exposure was calculated for NL toddler, representing 0.1% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI). This calculation indicates that the uses assessed under this review are unlikely to pose a risk to consumer's health. Acute exposure calculations were not carried out because an acute reference dose (ARfD) was not deemed necessary for this active substance.Regulation (EC) No 396/20051 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Regulation’) establishes the rules governing the setting and the review of pesticide maximum residue levels (MRLs) at European level. Article 12(1) of that Regulation stipulates that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) shall provide, within 12 months from the date of the inclusion or non‐inclusion of an active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC2 a reasoned opinion on the review of the existing MRLs for that active substance.As thiencarbazone‐methyl was approved on 1 July 2014 by means of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 145/20143 in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107/20094 as amended by Commission Implementing Regulations (EU) No 540/20115 and 541/20116, EFSA initiated the review of all existing MRLs for that active substance.By way of background information, in the framework of Commission Regulation (EU) No 188/20117 thiencarbazone‐methyl was evaluated by the United Kingdom, designated as rapporteur Member State (RMS). Subsequently, a peer review on the initial evaluation of the RMS was conducted by EFSA, leading to the conclusions as set out in the EFSA scientific output (EFSA, 2013).According to the legal provisions, EFSA shall base its reasoned opinion in particular on the relevant assessment report prepared under Directive 91/414/EEC repealed by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. It should be noted, however, that in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, only a few representative uses are evaluated, whereas MRLs set out in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 should accommodate all uses authorised within the European Union (EU), and uses authorised in third countries that have a significant impact on international trade. The information included in the assessment report prepared under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 is therefore insufficient for the assessment of all existing MRLs for a given active substance.To gain an overview of the pesticide residues data that have been considered for the setting of the existing MRLs, EFSA developed the Pesticide Residues Overview File (PROFile). The PROFile is an inventory of all pesticide residues data relevant to the risk assessment and MRL setting for a given active substance. This includes data on:\n\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in primary crops;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in processed commodities;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in rotational crops;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in livestock commodities;\nthe analytical methods for enforcement of the proposed MRLs.\nAs the basis for the MRL review, on 19 November 2018 EFSA initiated the collection of data for this active substance. In a first step, Member States were invited to submit by 19 December 2018 their Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) that are authorised nationally, in a standardised way, in the format of specific GAP forms. In the framework of this consultation 16 Member States provided feedback on their national authorisations of thiencarbazone‐methyl. Based on the GAP data submitted, the re‐assigned RMS France was asked to identify the critical GAPs (cGAPs) to be further considered in the assessment, in the format of a specific GAP overview file. Subsequently, in a second step, Member States were requested to provide residue data supporting the cGAPs by 28 February 2019.On the basis of all the data submitted by Member States and the EU Reference Laboratories for Pesticides Residues (EURLs), EFSA asked France to complete the PROFile and to prepare a supporting evaluation report. The PROFile and the supporting evaluation report, together with the Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) calculations and updated GAP overview file, were submitted to EFSA on 29 April 2019. Subsequently, EFSA performed the completeness check of these documents with the RMS. The outcome of this exercise including the clarifications provided by the RMS, if any, was compiled in the completeness check report.Considering all the available information, EFSA prepared in September 2019 a draft reasoned opinion, which was circulated to Member States and EURLs for commenting via a written procedure. All comments received by 17 October 2019 were considered by EFSA during the finalisation of the reasoned opinion.The evaluation report submitted by the RMS (France, 2019), taking into account also the information provided by Member States during the collection of data, and the EURLs report on analytical methods (EURLs, 2019) are considered as main supporting documents to this reasoned opinion and, thus, made publicly available.In addition, further supporting documents to this reasoned opinion are the completeness check report (EFSA, 2019a) and the Member States consultation report (EFSA, 2019b). These reports are developed to address all issues raised in the course of the review, from the initial completeness check to the reasoned opinion. Furthermore, the exposure calculations for all crops reported in the framework of this review performed using the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) and the PROFile as well as the GAP overview file listing all authorised uses are key supporting documents and made publicly available as background documents to this reasoned opinion. A screenshot of the report sheet of the PRIMo is presented in Appendix C.According to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, EFSA shall provide a reasoned opinion on:\n\nthe inclusion of the active substance in Annex IV to the Regulation, when appropriate;\nthe necessity of setting new MRLs for the active substance or deleting/modifying existing MRLs set out in Annex II or III of the Regulation;\nthe inclusion of the recommended MRLs in Annex II or III to the Regulation;\nthe setting of specific processing factors as referred to in Article 20(2) of the Regulation.\nThiencarbazone‐methyl is the modified ISO name for methyl 4‐[(4,5‐dihydro‐3‐methoxy‐4‐methyl‐5‐oxo‐1H‐1,2,4‐triazol‐1‐yl)carbonylsulfamoyl]‐5‐methylthiophene‐3‐carboxylate (IUPAC).The chemical structure of the active substance and its main metabolites are reported in Appendix F.For thiencarbazone‐methyl, default MRL of 0.01 mg/kg is established according to Art 18(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. Codex maximum residue limits (CXLs) for thiencarbazone‐methyl are not available. There are no MRL changes occurred since the entry into force of the Regulation mentioned above.For the purpose of this MRL review, all the uses of thiencarbazone‐methyl currently authorised within the EU as submitted by the Member States during the GAP collection, have been reported by the RMS in the GAP overview file. The cGAPs identified in the GAP overview file were then summarised in the PROFile and considered in the assessment. The details of the authorised critical GAPs for thiencarbazone‐methyl are given in Appendix A.EFSA has based its assessment on the following documents:\n\nthe PROFile submitted by the RMS;\nthe evaluation report accompanying the PROFile (France, 2019);\nthe draft assessment report (DAR) and its addenda prepared under Council Directive 91/414/EEC (United Kingdom, 2012, 2013);\nthe conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance thiencarbazone‐methyl (EFSA, 2013).\nThe assessment is performed in accordance with the legal provisions of the uniform principles for evaluation and authorisation of plant protection products as set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/20118 and the currently applicable guidance documents relevant for the consumer risk assessment of pesticide residues (European Commission, 1997a,b,c,d,e,f,g, 2000, 2010a,b, 2017; OECD, 2011, 2013).More detailed information on the available data and on the conclusions derived by EFSA can be retrieved from the list of end points reported in Appendix B.Thiencarbazone‐methyl is authorised for use on crops that might be fed to livestock (cereals, sugar and fodder beets). Livestock dietary burden calculations were therefore performed for different groups of livestock according to OECD guidance (OECD, 2013), which has now also been agreed upon at European level. The input values for all relevant commodities are summarised in Appendix D.Since the calculated dietary burdens for all groups of livestock were found to be below the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg dry matter (DM), further investigation of residues as well as the setting of MRLs in commodities of animal origin is unnecessary.Although not required, metabolism studies were available and assessed in the framework of the peer review (United Kingdom, 2012; EFSA, 2013). The metabolism of thiencarbazone‐methyl residues in livestock was investigated in lactating goats and laying hens at a dose rate of 2 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day, covering largely the maximum dietary burdens calculated in this review (France, 2019).In both studies, thiencarbazone‐methyl was radiolabelled in the dihydrotriazole or thiophene ring of the molecule. The studies performed with the dihydrotriazole label showed that the parent is extensively metabolised in all livestock matrices and, when detected, present in low proportions (≤ 8% TRR; 0.06 mg eq/kg). Whereas with the thiophene label, parent thiencarbazone‐methyl accounted for 83% TRR (0.004 mg eq/kg) in eggs and 80% TRR (0.102 mg eq/kg) in milk. The main metabolites identified in all matrices were BYH 18636‐MMT (49–70% TRR in poultry; 23‐49% TRR in goat) and methyl carbamate (13–23% TRR in poultry; 27–54% TRR in goat). In lactating goats, significant levels of BYH 18636‐sulfonamide were found up to 85% TRR (3.1 mg eq/kg) in liver, as well as BYH 18636‐sulfonamide carboxylic acid up to 52% TRR (0.35 mg eq/kg) in fat (United Kingdom, 2012).The metabolism in lactating goats and laying hens is very similar and residues result from the cleavage of the parent compound, oxidative N‐demethylation and hydrolysis steps.Parent thiencarbazone‐methyl and BYH 18636‐MMT were found to be the most relevant compounds in livestock commodities. Therefore, during the peer review, a residue definition for enforcement and for risk assessment was proposed as thiencarbazone‐methyl and BYH 18636‐MMT, expressed as thiencarbazone‐methyl (EFSA, 2013). Even if not required in the framework of this review, these residue definitions as derived from the available metabolism studies would still be valid if in the future, the dietary burdens were to be triggered.The storage stability of parent thiencarbazone‐methyl and BYH 18636‐MMT was not investigated and such data were not required. Nevertheless, a study to demonstrate the storage stability of BYH 18636‐sulfonamide for a period of two months at −18°C in fat and milk is available (United Kingdom, 2012; EFSA, 2013).A fully validated high‐performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS/MS) analytical method for the parent and metabolite BYH 18636‐MMT individually at the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg is available in all animal matrices (United Kingdom, 2012; EFSA, 2013; France, 2019). The enforcement LOQ of the proposed residue definition was calculated as a combined LOQ of 0.04 mg/kg, considering the molecular weights of each compound. According to the EURLs, the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg is achievable by using the QuEChERS method in routine analyses for the determination of the parent in muscle and liver, and of BYH 18636‐MMT in muscle, liver and eggs (EURLs, 2019).The metabolism studies in poultry and ruminants performed at an exaggerated dose rate (i.e. 1,100–2,200N rate compared to the maximum dietary burdens) is sufficient to conclude that residue levels would remain below the enforcement LOQ of 0.04 mg/kg in edible tissues, from the dietary burden resulting from the authorised uses of thiencarbazone‐methyl. No feeding study was required in the framework of the peer review and of this review. However, a US feeding study on lactating cows is available. The results of this study performed at a dose rate equivalent to 8N confirmed that no residues are expected in animal matrices (United Kingdom, 2012; EFSA, 2013).In the framework of this review, only the uses of thiencarbazone‐methyl reported by the RMS in Appendix A were considered.Chronic exposure calculations for all crops reported in the framework of this review were performed using revision 3 of the EFSA PRIMo (EFSA, 2018). Input values for the exposure calculations were derived in compliance with the decision tree reported in Appendix E. Hence, for those commodities where a (tentative) MRL could be derived by EFSA in the framework of this review, input values were derived according to the internationally agreed methodologies (FAO, 2009). All input values included in the exposure calculations are summarised in Appendix D. Acute exposure calculations were not carried out because an acute reference dose (ARfD) was not deemed necessary for this active substance.The exposure values calculated were compared with the toxicological reference value for thiencarbazone‐methyl, derived by EFSA (2013). The highest chronic exposure was calculated for NL toddler, representing 0.1% ADI. This calculation indicates that the uses assessed under this review result in a consumer exposure lower than the toxicological reference values. Therefore, these uses are unlikely to pose a risk to consumer's health.The metabolism of thiencarbazone‐methyl in plants was investigated in primary and rotational crops. According to the results of the metabolism studies on cereals and root and tuber vegetables, the residue definition for enforcement can be proposed as parent thiencarbazone‐methyl only. For risk assessment the residue definition is proposed as the sum of thiencarbazone‐methyl, BYH 18636‐N‐desmethyl and BYH 18636‐MMT‐glucoside, expressed as thiencarbazone‐methyl. These residue definitions are also applicable to rotational crops. For the current authorised uses, a residue definition is not needed for processed commodities.Fully validated analytical methods are available for the enforcement of the proposed residue definition in cereals and root and tuber vegetables at the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg. According to the EURLs, the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg is achievable by using the QuEChERS method in routine analyses. All compounds included in the risk assessment residue definition were demonstrated to be stable for at least 26 months in the relevant plant matrices.No residues above the LOQ were found in edible parts from rotational crops. However, a field rotational crop study performed at an exaggerated dose, covering the plateau concentration calculated for the persistent metabolite BYH 18636‐carboxylic acid, is still required to confirm that no significant residues of thiencarbazone‐methyl are expected following multiannual applications according to the most cGAP assessed in this review.Available residue trials data were considered sufficient to derive MRL proposals as well as risk assessment values for all commodities under evaluation. Specific MRLs for rotational crops are not needed, provided that Member States will take adequate risk mitigation measures in order to avoid significant residues to occur in rotational crops.Thiencarbazone‐methyl is authorised for use on crops that might be fed to livestock. Livestock dietary burden calculations were therefore performed for different groups of livestock according to OECD guidance. The dietary burdens calculated were found to be below the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg DM for each group and further investigation of residues as well as the setting of MRLs in commodities of animal origin is not necessary. Nevertheless, the metabolism of thiencarbazone‐methyl residues in livestock was investigated and a general residue definition for enforcement and risk assessment was proposed as thiencarbazone‐methyl and BYH 18636‐MMT, expressed as thiencarbazone‐methyl. Considering the authorised uses reported, a residue definition for livestock commodities is not required in the framework of this review. However, these residue definitions would be considered valid if in the future dietary burdens were to be triggered.An analytical method for the enforcement of the proposed residue definition at the combined LOQ of 0.04 mg/kg in all animal matrices is available. According to the EURLs the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg for each compound individually, is achievable by using the QuEChERS method in routine analyses.Chronic consumer exposure resulting from the authorised uses reported in the framework of this review was calculated using revision 3 of the EFSA PRIMo. The highest chronic exposure was calculated for NL toddler, representing 0.1% of the ADI. This calculation indicates that the uses assessed under this review are unlikely to pose a risk to consumer's health. Acute exposure calculations were not carried out because an ARfD was not deemed necessary for this active substance.MRL recommendations were derived in compliance with the decision tree reported in Appendix E of the reasoned opinion (see Table 1). All MRL values listed as ‘Recommended’ in the table are sufficiently supported by data and are therefore proposed for inclusion in Annex II to the Regulation. The remaining MRL values listed in the table are not recommended for inclusion in Annex II because they require further consideration by risk managers (see Table 1 footnotes for details).EFSA identified the following data gap which might have an impact on national authorisations:\n\na representative field rotational crop study covering the plateau concentration of metabolite BYH 18636‐carboxylic acid and analysing for this metabolite in the soil.\nPending the submission of this study, Member States granting authorisations for thiencarbazone‐methyl should take the appropriate risk mitigation measures or modify the relevant authorisations in order to avoid the presence of significant residues in rotational crops.\n\n\n\n\na.s.\n\nactive substance\n\n\n\n\nADI\n\nacceptable daily intake\n\n\n\n\nARfD\n\nacute reference dose\n\n\n\n\nBBCH\n\ngrowth stages of mono‐ and dicotyledonous plants\n\n\n\n\nbw\n\nbody weight\n\n\n\n\nCF\n\nconversion factor for enforcement residue definition to risk assessment residue definition\n\n\n\n\ncGAP\n\ncritical GAP\n\n\n\n\nCXL\n\ncodex maximum residue limit\n\n\n\n\nDAR\n\ndraft assessment report\n\n\n\n\nDAT\n\ndays after treatment\n\n\n\n\nDB\n\ndietary burden\n\n\n\n\nDM\n\ndry matter\n\n\n\n\nDT90\n\nperiod required for 90% dissipation (define method of estimation)\n\n\n\n\neq\n\nresidue expressed as a.s. equivalent\n\n\n\n\nEURLs\n\nEuropean Union Reference Laboratories for Pesticide Residues (former CRLs)\n\n\n\n\nFAO\n\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nHPLC–MS/MS\n\nhigh‐performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nHR\n\nhighest residue\n\n\n\n\nIEDI\n\ninternational estimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nILV\n\nindependent laboratory validation\n\n\n\n\nInChiKey\n\nInternational Chemical Identifier Key\n\n\n\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organisation for Standardization\n\n\n\n\nIUPAC\n\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n\n\n\n\nLC\n\nliquid chromatography\n\n\n\n\nLC–MS/MS\n\nliquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nLOQ\n\nlimit of quantification\n\n\n\n\nMo\n\nmonitoring\n\n\n\n\nMRL\n\nmaximum residue level\n\n\n\n\nMS/MS\n\ntandem mass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nNEDI\n\nnational estimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nNEU\n\nnorthern European Union\n\n\n\n\nNTMDI\n\nnational theoretical maximum daily intake\n\n\n\n\nOD\n\noil dispersion\n\n\n\n\nOECD\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development\n\n\n\n\nPBI\n\nplant‐back interval\n\n\n\n\nPF\n\nprocessing factor\n\n\n\n\nPHI\n\npreharvest interval\n\n\n\n\nPow\n\npartition coefficient between n‐octanol and water\n\n\n\n\nPRIMo\n\n(EFSA) Pesticide Residues Intake Model\n\n\n\n\nPROFile\n\n(EFSA) Pesticide Residues Overview File\n\n\n\n\nQuEChERS\n\nQuick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (analytical method)\n\n\n\n\nQuOil\n\nvariation of QuEChERS method for fat and oil content commodities\n\n\n\n\nRA\n\nrisk assessment\n\n\n\n\nRD\n\nresidue definition\n\n\n\n\nRMS\n\nrapporteur Member State\n\n\n\n\nSANCO\n\nDirectorate‐General for Health and Consumers\n\n\n\n\nSC\n\nsuspension concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSEU\n\nsouthern European Union\n\n\n\n\nSMILES\n\nsimplified molecular‐input line‐entry system\n\n\n\n\nSTMR\n\nsupervised trials median residue\n\n\n\n\nTMDI\n\ntheoretical maximum daily intake\n\n\n\n\nTRR\n\ntotal radioactive residue\n\n\n\n\nWG\n\nwater‐dispersible granule\n\n\n\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n"

        "summary": "According to Article 12 of Regulation ( ) No 396/2005,   has reviewed the maximum residue levels ( s) currently established at European level for the pesticide active substance ipconazole. To assess the occurrence of ipconazole residues in plants, processed commodities, rotational crops and livestock,   considered the conclusions derived in the framework of Regulation ( ) No 1107/2009 as well as the European authorisations reported by Member States (including the supporting residues data). Based on the assessment of the available data,   proposals were derived for ipconazole and a consumer risk assessment was carried out. All information required by the regulatory framework was present and a risk to consumers was not identified. Regarding triazole derivative metabolites ( s), separate indicative exposure assessments were performed for triazole alanine and triazole acetic acid and no risk to consumers was identified for what regards these two metabolites individually. However,  s may be generated by several pesticides belonging to the group of triazole fungicides, and a comprehensive risk assessment has thus to be performed that covers all existing European uses for all pesticides belonging to the class of triazole fungicides.   recommended to elaborate together with risk managers a strategy to ensure that the required data are made available to finalise the overall risk assessment for triazole fungicides.",
        "full-text": "Ipconazole was approved on 1 September 2014 by means of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 571/2014 in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as amended by Commission Implementing Regulations (EU) No 540/2011 and 541/2011.As the active substance was approved after the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 on 2 September 2008, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to provide a reasoned opinion on the review of the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for that active substance in compliance with Article 12(1) of the aforementioned regulation.As the basis for the MRL review, on 11 December 2018 EFSA initiated the collection of data for this active substance. In a first step, Member States were invited to submit by 11 January 2019 their national Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) in a standardised way, in the format of specific GAP forms, allowing the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS) Belgium to identify the critical GAPs in the format of a specific GAP overview file. Subsequently, Member States were requested to provide residues data supporting the critical GAPs, within a period of 1 month, by 21 February 2019. On the basis of all the data submitted by Member States and by the EU Reference Laboratories for Pesticide Residues (EURLs), EFSA asked the RMS to complete the Pesticide Residues Overview File (PROFile) and to prepare a supporting evaluation report. The PROFile and evaluation report, together with Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) calculations and updated GAP overview files were provided by the RMS to EFSA on 26 April 2019. Subsequently, EFSA performed the completeness check of these documents with the RMS. The outcome of this exercise including the clarifications provided by the RMS, if any, was compiled in the completeness check report.Based on the information provided by the RMS, Member States and the EURLs, and taking into account the conclusions derived by EFSA in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, EFSA prepared in October 2019 a draft reasoned opinion, which was circulated to Member States for consultation via a written procedure. Comments received by 11 November 2019 were considered during the finalisation of this reasoned opinion. The following conclusions are derived.The metabolism of ipconazole in plants was investigated in primary and rotational crops. According to the results of the metabolism studies, the residue definition for enforcement can be proposed as ipconazole. As regards risk assessment, four residue definitions are set separately: RD‐RA1. ipconazole; RD‐RA2. triazole alanine (TA) and triazole lactic acid (TLA); RD‐RA3. triazole acetic acid (TAA); and RD‐RA4. 1,2,4‐triazole (1,2,4‐T). These residue definitions are applicable to processed commodities. It has however, to be noted that TLA and 1,2,4‐T metabolites were not observed in the metabolism studies on primary and rotational crops conducted with ipconazole. Therefore, although included in the residue definition for all triazole active substances, these metabolites are not expected to be relevant for ipconazole.Analytical methods are available for the enforcement of the proposed residue definition in the four main plant matrices at the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.01 mg/kg. According to the EURLs, the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg (0.005 mg/kg for dry commodities) is achievable by using the QuEChERS method in routine analyses.It should be noted that in primary crops, significant levels of TA and TAA were often found in untreated samples, not related to the use of ipconazole as a seed treatment, suggesting the use of triazole pesticide active substances in previous seasons. In addition, where no triazoles have been applied in the previous two years, levels of TA and TAA are below the LOQ. This information should be considered by risk managers for the adoption of possible mitigation measures.The available residue trials data were considered sufficient to derive MRL proposals for monitoring as well as risk assessment values for parent ipconazole for all commodities under evaluation. Regarding TDMs, risk assessment values could be derived for TA and TAA for all commodities. Based on the metabolism studies performed with ipconazole, data were not required to derive any values for the other TDMs (TLA and 1,2,4‐T) in the framework of this review.Ipconazole is authorised for use on crops that might be fed to livestock. Livestock dietary burden calculations were therefore performed for different groups of livestock according to OECD guidance. According to the residue definitions relevant for risk assessment, separate calculations were performed for ipconazole, TA and TAA. For parent ipconazole, the calculated dietary burdens for all groups of livestock were found to be below the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg dry matter (DM), and further investigation of residues as well as the setting of MRLs for ipconazole in commodities of animal origin is unnecessary. Concerning metabolites TA and TAA, the calculated dietary burdens were found to exceed the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg DM for all groups and behaviour of both compounds in livestock was therefore assessed in all commodities of animal origin.Although not required, the metabolism of ipconazole in livestock was investigated in lactating goats at dose rate covering the maximum dietary burdens calculated in this review and a residue definition for enforcement in livestock commodities was proposed as ipconazole. This study performed in livestock is expected to cover the metabolism of TAA. A metabolism study was also available with TA directly fed to animals. As regards risk assessment, four residue definitions were set separately: RD‐RA1. Ipconazole; RD‐RA2. TA and TLA; RD‐RA3. TAA; and RD‐RA4. 1,2,4‐T. An analytical method for the enforcement of the proposed residue definition at the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg in all matrices (0.01 mg/L in milk) is available, but not supported by an independent laboratory validation (ILV). However, since no MRLs are considered necessary for animal commodities, no further data are required. No validation data for ipconazole are available within the EURLs for commodities of animal origin.No feeding studies to address the behaviour of parent ipconazole in livestock were provided nor required for this review. In the framework of the peer review on the risk assessment of TDMs, poultry and ruminants feeding studies were conducted respectively with TA and TAA. These studies were considered to derive risk assessment values in livestock matrices.Chronic and acute consumer exposure resulting from the authorised uses reported in the framework of this review was calculated using revision 3 of the EFSA PRIMo. EFSA performed separate consumer risk assessments for ipconazole (RD‐RA1), TA (only compound relevant for RD‐RA2) and TAA (RD‐RA3). For parent ipconazole, the highest chronic exposure was calculated for the Netherlands toddler representing 0.8% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI), and the highest acute exposure was calculated for wheat, representing 1% of the acute reference dose (ARfD). Indicatively, for TA, the highest chronic exposure was calculated for the Dutch toddler representing 0.7% of the ADI, and the highest acute exposure was calculated for wheat, representing 0.7% of the ARfD. Concerning TAA, the highest chronic exposure was also calculated for the Dutch toddler representing 0.1% of the ADI, and the highest acute exposure was calculated for milk and wheat, representing each 0.1% of the ARfD. These calculations indicate that the uses assessed under this review are unlikely to pose a risk to consumer's health.EFSA emphasises that a comprehensive risk assessment including all crops and all pesticides belonging to the class of triazole fungicides has not been performed in the framework of the current review. EFSA recommended to elaborate together with risk managers a strategy to ensure that all required data are made available to finalise the overall risk assessment for triazole fungicides.In addition, the potential preferential metabolism of each enantiomer of ipconazole in animals and plants was not investigated in the studies submitted and was therefore not considered. However, considering the large margin of safety in the exposure calculations for ipconazole, the potential change of isomer ratios in the final residues is not expected to be of concern for the authorised use assessed in this review. In case future uses of ipconazole would lead to a higher consumer exposure, further information regarding the impact of plant and/or livestock metabolism on the isomer ratio might be required.Regulation (EC) No 396/20051 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Regulation’) establishes the rules governing the setting and the review of pesticide maximum residue levels (MRLs) at European level. Article 12(1) of that Regulation stipulates that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) shall provide, within 12 months from the date of the inclusion or non‐inclusion of an active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC2 a reasoned opinion on the review of the existing MRLs for that active substance.As ipconazole was approved on 1 September 2014 by means of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 571/20143 in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107/20094 as amended by Commission Implementing Regulations (EU) No 540/20115 and 541/20116, EFSA initiated the review of all existing MRLs for that active substance.By way of background information, in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Ipconazole was evaluated by United Kingdom designated as rapporteur Member State (RMS). Subsequently, a peer review on the initial evaluation of the RMS was conducted by EFSA, leading to the conclusions as set out in the EFSA scientific output (EFSA, 2013). In addition, a peer review for the triazole derivative metabolites (TDMs) was conducted by EFSA (2018b) in light of confirmatory data.According to the legal provisions, EFSA shall base its reasoned opinion in particular on the relevant assessment report prepared under Directive 91/414/EEC repealed by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. It should be noted, however, that, in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, only a few representative uses are evaluated, whereas MRLs set out in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 should accommodate all uses authorised within the European Union (EU) and uses authorised in third countries that have a significant impact on international trade. The information included in the assessment report prepared under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 is therefore insufficient for the assessment of all existing MRLs for a given active substance.To gain an overview of the pesticide residues data that have been considered for the setting of the existing MRLs, EFSA developed the Pesticide Residues Overview File (PROFile). The PROFile is an inventory of all pesticide residues data relevant to the risk assessment and MRL setting for a given active substance. This includes data on:\n\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in primary crops;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in processed commodities;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in rotational crops;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in livestock commodities;\nthe analytical methods for enforcement of the proposed MRLs.\nAs the basis for the MRL review, on 11 December 2018 EFSA initiated the collection of data for this active substance. In a first step, Member States were invited to submit by 11 January 2019 their Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) that are authorised nationally, in a standardised way, in the format of specific GAP forms. In the framework of this consultation 18 Member States provided feedback on their national authorisations of ipconazole. Based on the GAP data submitted, the re‐assigned RMS Belgium was asked to identify the critical GAPs to be further considered in the assessment, in the format of a specific GAP overview file. Subsequently, in a second step, Member States were requested to provide residue data supporting the critical GAPs by 21 February 2019.On the basis of all the data submitted by Member States and the EU Reference Laboratories for Pesticides Residues (EURLs), EFSA asked Belgium to complete the PROFile and to prepare a supporting evaluation report. The PROFile and the supporting evaluation report, together with the Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) calculations and updated GAP overview file, were submitted to EFSA on 26 April 2019. Subsequently, EFSA performed the completeness check of these documents with the RMS. The outcome of this exercise including the clarifications provided by the RMS, if any, was compiled in the completeness check report. During this completeness check, all the submitted data available for this review on metabolites triazole alanine (TA) and triazole acetic acid (TAA) were compiled separately in two additional PROFiles. Since TDMs are not resulting from the use of ipconazole only but may be generated by several triazole fungicides, these PROFiles should not be considered as standalone assessments.Considering all the available information, EFSA prepared in October 2019 a draft reasoned opinion, which was circulated to Member States for commenting via a written procedure. All comments received by 11 November 2019 were considered by EFSA during the finalisation of the reasoned opinion.The evaluation report submitted by the RMS (Belgium, 2019), taking into account also the information provided by Member States during the collection of data, and the EURLs report on analytical methods (EURLs, 2019) are considered as main supporting documents to this reasoned opinion and, thus, made publicly available.In addition, further supporting documents to this reasoned opinion are the completeness check report (EFSA, 2019a) and the Member States consultation report (EFSA, 2019b). These reports are developed to address all issues raised in the course of the review, from the initial completeness check to the reasoned opinion. Furthermore, the exposure calculations for all crops reported in the framework of this review performed using the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) and the PROFiles as well as the GAP overview file listing all authorised uses are key supporting documents and made publicly available as background documents to this reasoned opinion. A screenshot of the report sheet of the PRIMo is presented in Appendix C.According to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, EFSA shall provide a reasoned opinion on:\n\nthe inclusion of the active substance in Annex IV to the Regulation, when appropriate;\nthe necessity of setting new MRLs for the active substance or deleting/modifying existing MRLs set out in Annex II or III of the Regulation;\nthe inclusion of the recommended MRLs in Annex II or III to the Regulation;\nthe setting of specific processing factors as referred to in Article 20(2) of the Regulation.\nIpconazole is the ISO common name for (1RS,2SR,5RS;1RS,2SR,5SR)‐2‐(4‐chlorobenzyl)‐5‐isopropyl‐1‐(1H‐1,2,4‐triazol‐1‐ylmethyl)cyclopentanol (IUPAC).Ipconazole is a triazole fungicide and shares common metabolites with all other triazole active substances. The chemical structure of the active substance and its main metabolites, including TDMs, are reported in Appendix F.Ipconazole is a mixture of two enantiomeric pairs of diastereomers, and since the analytical methods used in the studies reported for this review were not stereo‐selective, all values mentioned as ‘ipconazole’ have to be considered as ‘sum of isomers’.The EU MRLs for ipconazole are established in Annexes IIIA of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. No MRL changes occurred since the entry into force of the Regulation mentioned above.For the purpose of this MRL review, all the uses of ipconazole currently authorised within the EU as submitted by the Member States during the GAP collection, have been reported by the RMS in the GAP overview file. The critical GAPs identified in the GAP overview file were then summarised in the PROFiles and considered in the assessment. The details of the authorised critical GAPs for ipconazole are given in Appendix A.EFSA has based its assessment on the following documents:\n\nthe PROFile of parent ipconazole submitted by the RMS;\nthe additional PROFiles of TA and of TAA compiled during the completeness check;\nthe evaluation report accompanying the PROFiles (Belgium, 2019);\nthe draft assessment report (DAR) and its addenda prepared under Council Directive 91/414/EEC (United Kingdom, 2011, 2013);\nthe conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance ipconazole (EFSA, 2013);\nthe conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the TDMs in light of confirmatory data submitted (EFSA, 2018b).\nThe assessment is performed in accordance with the legal provisions of the uniform principles for evaluation and authorisation of plant protection products as set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/20117 and the currently applicable guidance documents relevant for the consumer risk assessment of pesticide residues (European Commission, 1997a–g, 2000, 2010a,b 2017; OECD, 2011, 2013).More detailed information on the available data and on the conclusions derived by EFSA can be retrieved from the list of end points reported in Appendix B.Ipconazole is authorised for use on cereals that might be fed to livestock. Livestock dietary burden calculations were therefore performed for different groups of livestock according to OECD guidance (OECD, 2013), which has now also been agreed upon at European level. The input values for all relevant commodities are summarised in Appendix D.Following the recently published EFSA conclusion on TDMs (EFSA, 2018b), the animal dietary burden should be calculated in accordance with the agreed residue definitions for risk assessment as derived for triazole pesticide active substances. However, since TLA and 1,2,4‐T were not identified in the metabolic pathway of primary crops, the livestock exposure to these compounds resulting from the authorised uses of ipconazole is expected to be negligible.In the framework of this review, dietary burden calculations were thus performed for parent ipconazole (RD‐RA1), TA (only metabolite relevant for RD‐RA2) and TAA (RD‐RA3).For parent ipconazole, the calculated dietary burdens for all groups of livestock were found to be below the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg dry matter (DM), thus further investigation of residues as well as the setting of MRLs in commodities of animal origin is unnecessary.Regarding TA and TAA, the respective calculated dietary burdens were found to exceed the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg DM for all groups of livestock.As different toxicological reference values were derived respectively for ipconazole and for the TDMs, EFSA performed separate consumer risk assessments for ipconazole (RD‐RA1), TA (only relevant metabolite for RD‐RA2) and TAA (RD‐RA3) based on the available data for this review. A separate risk assessment for 1,2,4‐T (RD‐RA4) is not needed, since this metabolite is not expected in crops, considering the metabolism of ipconazole.In the framework of this review, only the uses of ipconazole reported by the RMS in Appendix A were considered.For ipconazole, TA and TAA, chronic and acute exposure calculations for all crops reported in the framework of this review were performed using revision 3 of the EFSA PRIMo (EFSA, 2018a). Input values for the exposure calculations were derived in compliance with the decision tree reported in Appendix E. Hence, for those commodities where an MRL could be derived by EFSA in the framework of this review, input values were derived according to the internationally agreed methodologies (FAO, 2009). All input values included in the exposure calculations are summarised in Appendix D.The metabolism of ipconazole in plants was investigated in primary and rotational crops. According to the results of the metabolism studies, the residue definition for enforcement can be proposed as ipconazole. As regards risk assessment, four residue definitions are set separately: RD‐RA1. ipconazole, RD‐RA2. TA and TLA, RD‐RA3. TAA, RD‐RA4. 1,2,4‐T. These residue definitions are applicable to processed commodities. It has, however, to be noted that metabolites TLA and 1,2,4‐T were not observed in the metabolism studies on primary and rotational crops conducted with ipconazole. Therefore, although included in the residue definition for all triazole active substances, these metabolites are not expected to be relevant for ipconazole.Analytical methods are available for the enforcement of the proposed residue definition in the four main plant matrices at the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg. According to the EURLs, the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg (0.005 mg/kg for dry commodities) is achievable by using the QuEChERS method in routine analyses.It should be noted that in primary crops, significant levels of TA and TAA were often found in untreated samples, not related to the use if ipconazole as a seed treatment, suggesting the use of triazole pesticide active substances in previous seasons. In addition, where no triazoles have been applied in the previous two years, levels of TA and TAA are below the LOQ. This information should be considered by risk managers for the adoption of possible mitigation measures.The available residue trials data were considered sufficient to derive MRL proposals for monitoring as well as risk assessment values for parent ipconazole for all commodities under evaluation. Regarding TDMs, risk assessment values could be derived for TA and TAA for all commodities. Based on the metabolism studies performed with ipconazole, data were not required to derive any values for the other TDMs (TLA and 1,2,4‐T) in the framework of this review.Ipconazole is authorised for use on crops that might be fed to livestock. Livestock dietary burden calculations were therefore performed for different groups of livestock according to OECD guidance. According to the residue definitions relevant for risk assessment, separate calculations were performed for ipconazole, TA and TAA. For parent ipconazole, the calculated dietary burdens for all groups of livestock were found to be below the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg DM, and further investigation of residues as well as the setting of MRLs for ipconazole in commodities of animal origin is unnecessary. Concerning metabolites TA and TAA, the calculated dietary burdens were found to exceed the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg DM for all groups and behaviour of both compounds in livestock was therefore assessed in all commodities of animal origin.Although not required, the metabolism of ipconazole in livestock was investigated in lactating goats at dose rate covering the maximum dietary burdens calculated in this review and a residue definition for enforcement in livestock commodities was proposed as ipconazole. This study performed in livestock is expected to cover the metabolism of TAA. A metabolism study was also available with TA directly fed to animals. As regards risk assessment, four residue definitions were set separately: RD‐RA1. ipconazole, RD‐RA2. TA and TLA, RD‐RA3. TAA, RD‐RA4. 1,2,4‐T. An analytical method for the enforcement of the proposed residue definition at the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg in all matrices (0.01 mg/L in milk) is available, but not supported by an ILV. However, since no MRLs are considered necessary for animal commodities, no further data are required. No validation data for ipconazole is available within the EURLs for commodities of animal origin.No feeding studies to address the behaviour of parent ipconazole in livestock were provided nor required for this review. In the framework of the peer review on the risk assessment of TDMs, poultry and ruminants feeding studies were conducted respectively with TA and TAA. These studies were considered to derive risk assessment values in livestock matrices.Chronic and acute consumer exposure resulting from the authorised uses reported in the framework of this review was calculated using revision 3 of the EFSA PRIMo. EFSA performed separate consumer risk assessments for ipconazole (RD‐RA1), TA (only compound relevant for RD‐RA2) and TAA (RD‐RA3). For parent ipconazole, the highest chronic exposure was calculated for the Netherlands toddler representing 0.8% of the ADI, and the highest acute exposure was calculated for wheat, representing 1% of the ARfD. Indicatively, for TA, the highest chronic exposure was calculated for the Netherlands toddler representing 0.7% of the ADI, and the highest acute exposure was calculated for wheat, representing 0.7% of the ARfD. Concerning TAA, the highest chronic exposure was also calculated for the Netherlands toddler representing 0.1% of the ADI, and the highest acute exposure was calculated for milk and wheat, representing each 0.1% of the ARfD. These calculations indicate that the uses assessed under this review are unlikely to pose a risk to consumer's health.EFSA emphasises that a comprehensive risk assessment including all crops and all pesticides belonging to the class of triazole fungicides has not been performed in the framework of the current review. EFSA recommended to elaborate together with risk managers a strategy to ensure that all required data are made available to finalise the overall risk assessment for triazole fungicides.In addition, the potential preferential metabolism of each enantiomer of ipconazole in animals and plants was not investigated in the studies submitted and was therefore not considered. However, considering the large margin of safety in the exposure calculations for ipconazole, the potential change of isomer ratios in the final residues is not expected to be of concern for the authorised use assessed in this review. In case future uses of ipconazole would lead to a higher consumer exposure, further information regarding the impact of plant and/or livestock metabolism on the isomer ratio might be required.MRL recommendations were derived in compliance with the decision tree reported in Appendix E of the reasoned opinion (see Table 1). All MRL values listed as ‘Recommended’ in the table are sufficiently supported by data and are therefore proposed for inclusion in Annex II to the Regulation. The remaining MRL values listed in the table are not recommended for inclusion in Annex II because they require further consideration by risk managers (see Table 1 footnotes for details).EFSA emphasises that a comprehensive risk assessment that covers all existing EU uses for all pesticides belonging to the class of triazole fungicides has still to be performed. EFSA recommended to elaborate together with risk managers a strategy to ensure that the required data are made available to finalise the overall risk assessment for triazole fungicides.\n\n\n\n\n1,2,4‐T\n\n1,2,4‐triazole\n\n\n\n\na.s.\n\nactive substance\n\n\n\n\nADI\n\nacceptable daily intake\n\n\n\n\nARfD\n\nacute reference dose\n\n\n\n\nBBCH\n\ngrowth stages of mono‐ and dicotyledonous plants\n\n\n\n\nbw\n\nbody weight\n\n\n\n\nCF\n\nconversion factor for enforcement residue definition to risk assessment residue definition\n\n\n\n\nCXL\n\ncodex maximum residue limit\n\n\n\n\nDAR\n\ndraft assessment report\n\n\n\n\nDAT\n\ndays after treatment\n\n\n\n\nDB\n\ndietary burden\n\n\n\n\nDM\n\ndry matter\n\n\n\n\nDT90\n\nperiod required for 90% dissipation (define method of estimation)\n\n\n\n\neq\n\nresidue expressed as a.s. equivalent\n\n\n\n\nEURLs\n\nEuropean Union Reference Laboratories for Pesticide Residues (former CRLs)\n\n\n\n\nFS\n\nflowable concentrate for seed treatment\n\n\n\n\nFAO\n\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nGC–MS/MS\n\ngas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nHPLC–MS/MS\n\nhigh‐performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nHR\n\nhighest residue\n\n\n\n\nIEDI\n\ninternational estimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nIESTI\n\ninternational estimated short‐term intake\n\n\n\n\nILV\n\nindependent laboratory validation\n\n\n\n\nInChiKey\n\nInternational Chemical Identifier Key\n\n\n\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organisation for Standardization\n\n\n\n\nIUPAC\n\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n\n\n\n\nLC–MS/MS\n\nliquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nLOQ\n\nlimit of quantification\n\n\n\n\nME\n\nmicro‐emulsion\n\n\n\n\nMo\n\nmonitoring\n\n\n\n\nMRL\n\nmaximum residue level\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nMember States\n\n\n\n\nNEDI\n\nnational estimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nNESTI\n\nnational estimated short‐term intake\n\n\n\n\nNEU\n\nnorthern European Union\n\n\n\n\nNTMDI\n\nnational theoretical maximum daily intake\n\n\n\n\nOECD\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development\n\n\n\n\nPBI\n\nplant‐back interval\n\n\n\n\nPECsoil\n\npredicted environmental concentration in soil\n\n\n\n\nPF\n\nprocessing factor\n\n\n\n\nPHI\n\npreharvest interval\n\n\n\n\nPow\n\npartition coefficient between n‐octanol and water\n\n\n\n\nPRIMo\n\n(EFSA) Pesticide Residues Intake Model\n\n\n\n\nPROFile\n\n(EFSA) Pesticide Residues Overview File\n\n\n\n\nQuEChERS\n\nquick, easy, cheap, effective and safe method\n\n\n\n\nRA\n\nrisk assessment\n\n\n\n\nRD\n\nresidue definition\n\n\n\n\nRMS\n\nrapporteur Member State\n\n\n\n\nSANCO\n\nDirectorate‐General for Health and Consumers\n\n\n\n\nSC\n\nsuspension concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSEU\n\nsouthern European Union\n\n\n\n\nSMILES\n\nsimplified molecular‐input line‐entry system\n\n\n\n\nSRM\n\nSelected reaction monitoring\n\n\n\n\nSTMR\n\nsupervised trials median residue\n\n\n\n\nTA\n\ntriazole alanine\n\n\n\n\nTAA\n\ntriazole acetic acid\n\n\n\n\nTAR\n\ntotal applied radioactivity\n\n\n\n\nTDM\n\ntriazole derivative metabolite\n\n\n\n\nTLA\n\ntriazole lactic acid\n\n\n\n\nTMDI\n\ntheoretical maximum daily intake\n\n\n\n\nTRR\n\ntotal radioactive residue\n\n\n\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n"

        "summary": "The provisional molecular approach, proposed by   in 2013, for the pathogenicity assessment of Shiga toxin‐producing   ( ) has been reviewed. Analysis of the confirmed reported human   infections in the  /  (2012–2017) demonstrated that isolates positive for any of the reported Shiga toxin (Stx) subtypes (and encoding   gene subtypes) may be associated with severe illness (defined as bloody diarrhoea ( ), haemolytic uraemic syndrome ( ) and/or hospitalisation). Although strains positive for   gene showed the highest rates, strains with all other   subtypes, or combinations thereof, were also associated with at least one human case with a severe clinical outcome. Serogroup cannot be used as a predictor of clinical outcome and the presence of the intimin gene ( ) is not essential for severe illness. These findings are supported by the published literature, a review of which suggested there was no single or combination of virulence markers associated exclusively with severe illness. Based on available evidence, it was concluded that all   strains are pathogenic in humans, capable of causing at least diarrhoea and that all   subtypes may be associated with severe illness. Source attribution analysis, based on ‘strong evidence’ outbreak data in the  /  (2012–2017), suggests that ‘bovine meat and products thereof’, ‘milk and dairy products’, ‘tap water including well water’ and ‘vegetables, fruit and products thereof’ are the main sources of   infections in the  / , but a ranking between these categories cannot be made as the data are insufficient. Other food commodities are also potentially associated with   infections but rank lower. Data gaps are identified, and are primarily caused by the lack of harmonisation in sampling strategies, sampling methods, detection and characterisation methods, data collation and reporting within the  .",
        "full-text": "The European Commission (EC) requested that European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) provides a scientific opinion that reviews the new information available since 2013 and uses this to assess if the molecular approach to defining Shiga toxin‐producing Escherichia coli (STEC) pathogenicity, proposed in the EFSA STEC opinion published in that year, is still the most appropriate and if not, whether it could be further revised. EFSA was also asked to provide updated information on the methods that may be used to detect and characterise STEC in humans, animals, feed and food and to rank relevant food commodities in terms of their associated STEC risk of human infection. Finally, the European Commission also requested EFSA to identify relevant data gaps when addressing the previous questions and provide recommendations on how these data gaps could be filled.A literature review was used to gather scientific publications, reports and official documents published between 2012 and 2019. The information obtained was used by the working group (WG) experts to develop the pathogenicity assessment and to describe the detection and typing methods currently available. Ranking food commodities based on the associated public health risk from STEC was performed using source attribution models and data from a range of sources. The data used in this opinion included; [1] the data reported to the European Surveillance System (TESSy) on STEC in humans between 2012 and 2017; [2] the data reported in the zoonoses database on the occurrence of STEC in food, feed and animals (2012–2017) and [3] the data reported in the zoonoses database on the occurrence of strong and weak evidence STEC food‐borne and waterborne outbreaks. Furthermore, data were obtained from public health national reference laboratories in 29 EU/EEA Member States (MSs) on STEC in humans and from the national contact points of the National Reference Laboratories in 28 MSs on STEC in food, feed and animals, using questionnaires. Analysis of the information available in the peer‐reviewed literature and data in the TESSy database (2012–2017) suggested that serogroup, intimin (eae) variant or Stx toxin subtype could not be used to predict clinical outcome. Intimin was present in the majority but not all STEC infections associated with severe illness (bloody diarrhoea (BD), haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) and/or hospitalisation). There is currently insufficient data to test for an association between intimin variant and disease outcome. All Stx toxin subtypes were associated with some cases of severe illness suggesting all STEC strains are potentially associated with BD, HUS and/or hospitalisation. Thus, the molecular approach for categorisation of STEC pathogenicity can be revised with all STEC being considered to be pathogenic and capable of causing severe illness. Future analysis, using tools such as whole genome sequencing (WGS), has the potential to identify virulence genes or gene combinations that are more often associated with severe illness, but any prediction of clinical outcome will always be uncertain as other factors, e.g., gene expression in the bacteria and the immune status of the host are also important.Current methods for detecting STEC in humans, animal, feed and food samples are described as are their limitations, especially with respect to lack of sensitivity for detecting STEC in food samples and animal faeces. Success in harmonisation of detection methods used for testing food samples has been obtained as most laboratories now use the ISO TS 13136 method. However, currently the method only allows detection of stx1 and/or stx2 and does not include stx subtyping. Harmonisation of sampling strategies, sampling methods, testing of human and animal samples and strain characterisation across the EU would greatly progress our understanding of this pathogen.Source attribution analysis based on ‘strong evidence outbreaks’ suggested that ‘bovine meat and products thereof’, ‘milk and dairy products’, ‘tap water including well water’ and ‘vegetables, fruit and products thereof’ are the main sources of STEC infections in the EU. However, there are several uncertainties associated with this analysis, as using ‘strong evidence outbreak’ data only means the data set is limited. Thus, it is not possible to provide a ranking within these four different food commodities. Moreover, other food commodities are also potentially associated with STEC infections, but rank lower.Despite many years of research and testing of animals, food, feed and human samples, there are still many unanswered questions about STEC. The current data gaps that prevent a more comprehensive assessment of any association between an individual gene or combinations of genes, and disease outcome include comprehensive virulence gene profiles for human STEC isolates (as a minimum, data are lacking on the presence/absence of specific Shiga toxin subtypes) and metadata on humans infected with STEC including age, immune status, therapeutic treatments, medical history, etc. More accurate ranking of foods to target specific food chains for STEC control interventions, including potential microbiological criteria/performance objectives, would require more comprehensive knowledge of the prevalence and concentrations of STEC in animals and food in the EU. Moreover, data on the sources and transmission routes of STEC infections in humans would have to be identified as would data on person‐to‐person transmission, dose‐response and the virulence gene profiles in STEC isolates from food, feed and animals.Questionnaires sent to relevant laboratories in the EU on surveillance/testing of STEC in humans and in food, feed and animals provide an important insight into why these data gaps exist and how they could be addressed. STEC testing within the EU should be harmonised including sampling strategies, sampling methods and reporting. All MSs should use the same case definition and outbreak investigation systems. Moreover, it should be a mandatory requirement to report all data (animal, food, feed and human) to EFSA/ECDC. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) technologies would facilitate these improvements for typing strains.The main conclusions include: [1] the molecular approach, described in EFSA 2013, for the pathogenicity assessment of STEC has been revised to consider Stx subtypes; [2] all STEC strains are pathogenic in humans, capable of causing at least diarrhoea and, based on the analysis of the stx subtypes and the presence/absence of the eae gene, all STEC subtypes may be associated with severe illness, i.e. HUS, BD and/or hospitalisations; [3] stx2a showed the highest rates of HUS, hospitalisation and BD; however, all other stx subtypes, or combinations thereof, were also associated with at least one of these severe illness outcomes; [4] the presence of intimin (eae gene) was an aggravating factor, but this virulence factor was not always essential for severe illness, suggesting that there is an alternative mechanism of attachment; [5] there is a range of methods (e.g. immunological and molecular methods) available for the detection of STEC but their effectiveness are limited by the need to demonstrate that the signals identified are derived from a live bacterial cell, which, in turn, is affected by lack of selectivity of culture media with respect to the ability to discriminate between STEC and other E. coli; [6] at EU level, the methodology for STEC detection in food is substantially harmonised. For example, the international standard ISO TS 13136:2012 has been used to test the 97.4% of the food samples reported to EFSA in 2017; [7] there are a range of characterisation methods including sero, phage and molecular typing. At EU level, the methodology for STEC characterisation in food isolates is not currently standardised, and [8] data on strong evidence outbreaks reported to EFSA from 2012 to 2017 were analysed by an established source attribution method and it was concluded that ‘bovine meat and products thereof’, ‘milk and dairy products’, ‘tap water including well water’ and ‘vegetables, fruit and products thereof’ are the main food commodities causing human STEC outbreaks. Other food commodities are potentially associated with STEC infections but rank lower.Recommendations to fill STEC data gaps in the EU include; [1] harmonisation of sampling (surveillance strategies, case definition, number of samples tested, etc.) and testing (although most laboratories in the different MS use the ISO TS 13136:2012 method for testing food and feed samples); [2] MSs should develop national guidelines for the detection of STEC in human samples and the characterisation of isolated strains. Clinical detection and characterisation methods should be harmonised across the EU. Additionally, the use of WGS to type the isolated STEC is strongly recommended; [3] the objectives for STEC surveillance should be changed to ensure all MSs collect data on all STEC cases and not just HUS cases. Public health and other laboratories supporting the healthcare system in MSs should be encouraged to isolate STEC from all STEC patients and undertake WGS analysis using a methodology that is harmonised across the EU. Extensive metadata (age, immune status, therapeutic treatments, medical history, etc.) for each patient infected with STEC in individual MSs should also be collected and all this data/information forwarded to ECDC and [4] the STEC reporting system in the EU should be reviewed focusing on user‐friendly and efficient sharing and reporting systems.Answer to ToR 1. Review the new body of knowledge available for pathogenicity assessment of STEC, and refine, if needed, the molecular approach for the categorisation of STEC strains proposed in the EFSA 2013 Opinion.\n\nThe molecular approach described in EFSA 2013 for the pathogenicity assessment of STEC has been revised to consider stx subtypes as described below.\nBased on the available evidence, it is concluded that all STEC strains are pathogenic in humans, capable of causing at least diarrhoea. Moreover, based on the analysis of the stx subtypes, all STEC subtypes may be associated with severe illness, i.e. HUS, BD and/or hospitalisation. Although stx2a showed the highest rates of HUS, hospitalisation and BD, all other stx subtypes or combinations thereof, for which there was sufficient data, were also associated with at least one of these severe illness outcomes.\nThe presence of intimin (eae gene) was an aggravating factor, but this virulence factor was not always essential for severe illness.\nThe minimum combination of genes required to cause severe illness is unknown and even if it was established there are many contributory factors such as gene expression levels, alternative genes performing similar functions and host factors.\nAnswer to ToR 2. Review the microbiological methods for the detection and characterisation of human pathogenic STEC in animals and food.\n\nThere are a range of methods (e.g. immunological and molecular methods) available for the detection of STEC, but their effectiveness is limited by the need to demonstrate that the signals identified are derived from a live bacterial cell, which, in turn, is affected by lack of sensitivity in the isolation step, which is necessary to demonstrate that the isolated E. coli possess the stx genes and thus to discriminate between STEC and other E. coli.\nAt EU level, the methodology for STEC detection in food is substantially harmonised. For example, the international standard ISO TS 13136:2012 has been used to test the 97.4% of the food samples reported to EFSA in 2017.\nThere are also a range of characterisation methods including sero‐, phage‐ and molecular typing. At EU level, the methodology for STEC characterisation in food isolates is not currently standardised. However, the revision of the standard ISO TS 13136, which is ongoing, will include part 2 of the document dedicated to STEC strain characterisation, including also the advice to use more holistic characterisation approaches such as WGS.\nAnswer to ToR 3. Analyse available data on human food‐borne STEC cases in the EU and rank different food commodities based on the public health risk.\n\nData on ‘strong evidence’ outbreaks reported to EFSA from 2012 to 2017 were analysed by an established source attribution method and the results were critically evaluated and considered in the light of other evidence.\nIt was concluded that ‘bovine meat and products thereof’, ‘milk and dairy products’, ‘tap water including well water’ and ‘vegetables, fruit and products thereof’ are the main food commodities causing human STEC infections. Other food commodities are also potentially associated with STEC infections, but rank lower.\nAnswer to ToR 4. To provide recommendations to fill the data gaps identified in the above assessment.The following are recommended to fill the data gaps identified:\n\nThere should be harmonisation of sampling (surveillance strategies, case definition, number of samples tested, etc.) and testing (although most laboratories in the different MS use the ISO TS 13136:2012 method for testing food and feed samples).\nMSs should develop national guidelines for the detection of STEC in human samples and the characterisation of isolated strains. Clinical detection and characterisation methods should be harmonised across the EU. Additionally, the use of WGS to type the isolated STEC is strongly recommended.\nThe objectives for STEC surveillance should be changed to ensure that all MSs collect and collate data on all STEC cases and not just HUS cases. Public health and other laboratories supporting the healthcare system in MSs should be encouraged to isolate STEC from all patients with a positive STEC PCR or other detection test and undertake WGS analysis using a methodology that is harmonised across the EU. Extensive metadata (age, immune status, therapeutic treatments, medical history, etc.) for each patient infected with STEC in individual MSs should also be collected and all these data/information forwarded to ECDC.\nThe STEC reporting in the EU should be reviewed, focusing on user‐friendly and efficient sharing and reporting systems.\n\n\n\nMethods should be developed and validated for analysing WGS data from animal, food, feed and human isolates to identify trends and emerging STEC strains in a timely manner.\n\nSTEC WGS operational systems need to be developed and implemented for sharing interoperable WGS data. The data should be well documented in a comprehensible and standardised way and include strain associated anonymised metadata (information about the source, strain history, epidemiological information, etc.) thus overcoming ethical, legal and/or commercial issues.\n\nResearch and development should be undertaken on (1) the improvement of isolation methods for STEC; (2) the epidemiology of STEC in foods including food, animals and environmental sources; (3) the impact of host factors on the outcomes of STEC infection and (4) toxin expression (including the relationship between the bacteriophage encoding the Shiga toxin and the levels of production) and its transport to the final location in the human body.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloody diarrhoea (BD)\n\nAny report from patient or treating medical doctor or general practitioner of blood in the stool. Will cover anything from scanty blood to all blood and no stool. Therefore not clearly defined in Smany papers\n\n\n\n\nCross‐pathotype strains\n\nstrain harbouring pathogenicity genes associated with more than one pathovar/pathotype, for example, STEC carrying eae associated with EPEC and stx genes\n\n\n\nHaemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) \nIn medicine, haemolytic‐uremic syndrome, abbreviated (HUS) is a disease characterised by acute microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (Hb < 10g/dl with microscopic evidence of fragmented blood cells), low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) (Platelets < 100–150,000 × 109/L) and acute renal failure (Oliguria or anuria with elevated serum urea and creatinine above the upper limit for age)\n\n\nHaemorrhagic colitis (HC) \nMost often will include abdominal cramps, copious bloody diarrhoea described as ‘all blood and no stool’, unaccompanied by faecal leukocytes, and variable fever\n\n\nHUS‐associated E. coli (HUSEC) \nSTEC isolated from HUS cases or belonging to serotypes or sequence types or virulotypes known to be associated with HUS cases\n\n\n\nPathogenicity\n\nthe ability of an organism to cause disease (i.e. harm the host) or otherwise induce pathological change in a susceptible host\n\n\n\n\nPathotype\n\nan E. coli population characterised by the presence a common set of virulence factors. Specific pathotypes such as EPEC or ETEC are often linked to a common presentation of clinical symptoms such as persistent diarrhoea in children caused by EPEC or short term self‐limiting travellers’ diarrhoea by ETEC. This concept has been further refined for STEC to help assess the clinical and public health risks associated with different STEC strains\n\n\n\n\nSeropathotype\n\nan empirical classification scheme used to classify STEC serotypes into five groups (A through E) according to the reported association of serotypes and virulence genes assets with human intestinal disease, outbreaks, and haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic‐uremic syndrome (HUS) (Karmali et al., 2003)\n\n\n\n\nSerotype\n\na designation of the somatic O antigen and flagellar H antigen separated with an ‘:’ e.g. O157:H7 or O104:H4 in a given strain. The full serotype may include acidic capsular antigen K and fimbrial antigen F, which is primarily used in the serotyping of ExPEC or UPEC strains e.g. O25:K2:H2; F16 or O6:K15:H31; F536\n\n\n\n\nSerogroup\n\noften used to refer to the somatic O antigen e.g. O157 or O104. The correct designation of the O antigen should be O group as there are serological variants e.g. O28ab and O28ac. Different LPS patterns of O157 are often linked to specific H types\n\n\n\nSpecies (in this case Escherichia coli) \na taxonomic subdivision of a genus (in this case Escherichia). A group of closely related and morphologically similar organisms that, actually or potentially, interbreed. The concept of a bacterial species has traditionally been based on a number of biochemical reactions. Chromosomal DNA‐DNA cross‐hybridisation has been used to define a species with a general cut off value of more than 70% identity. Similarity of the ribosomal 16S rRNA gene has also been used to define bacterial species. The taxonomic classification of bacteria is described in Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology, 2005\n\n\n\nStrain\n\na particular variety of a bacterial species, in this case Escherichia coli. Usually well characterised in terms of phenotypic, biochemical and/or genetic features pertaining to a given species. An isolate is a yet uncharacterised single strain isolated from a mixed matrix such as food, faeces, urine or blood etc\n\n\n\n\nVirulence\n\nis the ability of STEC to harm the host. It may include the colonization of a specific body compartment, accomplished either by invading the tissues and multiplying in the host or by attaching and causing lesions to the mucosa or other tissues. Additionally, it may be related with the production of toxins (e.g. Shiga toxins, Subtilase, Enterohaemolysin for STEC). STEC can exhibit different degrees of virulence depending on particular characteristics of different strains, i.e. their pool of virulence genes\n\n\n\n\nVirulence factor\n\nproteins encoded by genes generally present on mobile genetic elements end specifying factors involved in the pathogenesis of the STEC‐induced disease\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAAF\n\naggregative adherence fimbriae\n\n\n\n\nA/E\n\nattaching and effacing (bacteria)\n\n\n\n\naEPEC\n\natypical EPEC\n\n\n\n\nAfa\n\nafimbrial adhesins\n\n\n\n\nAIDA‐I\n\nadhesin involved in diffuse adherence\n\n\n\n\nAIEC\n\nadherent invasive E. coli\n\n\n\n\nAMR\n\nantimicrobial resistance\n\n\n\n\nBD\n\nbloody diarrhoea\n\n\n\n\nBfp\n\nbundle forming pili\n\n\n\n\nCA\n\ncompetent authority\n\n\n\n\nCFA\n\ncolonisation factor antigens\n\n\n\n\nCFU\n\ncolony forming units\n\n\n\n\nCI\n\nconfidence interval\n\n\n\n\ncgMLST\n\ncore genome MLST\n\n\n\n\nD\n\ndiarrhoea\n\n\n\n\nDAEC\n\ndffusely adherent E. coli\n\n\n\n\nDAF\n\ndecay‐accelerating factor\n\n\n\n\nDEC\n\ndiarrhoeagenic E. coli\n\n\n\n\nDr\n\nDrori antigen\n\n\n\n\nEAEC\n\nenteroaggregative E. coli\n\n\n\n\nEAF\n\nEPEC adherence factor\n\n\n\n\nEAST1\n\nenteroaggregative heat stable toxin\n\n\n\n\nEHEC\n\nenterohaemorrhagic E. coli\n\n\n\n\nEIEC\n\nenteroinvasive E. coli\n\n\n\n\nEPEC\n\nenteropathogenic E. coli\n\n\n\n\nETEC\n\nenterotoxigenic E. coli\n\n\n\n\nExPEC\n\nextra‐intestinal pathogenic E. coli\n\n\n\n\nEU‐FORS\n\nEuropean Union Food‐borne Reporting System\n\n\n\n\nEUR\n\nEuropean region\n\n\n\n\nFBO\n\nfood‐borne outbreak(s)\n\n\n\n\nFWD\n\nfood‐ and waterborne disease\n\n\n\n\nGI\n\ngenomic island\n\n\n\n\nHC\n\nhaemorhagic colitis\n\n\n\n\nHosp\n\nhospitalised\n\n\n\n\nHUS\n\nhaemolytic uremic syndrome\n\n\n\n\nHUSEC\n\nHUS‐associated E.coli\n\n\n\n\nIpa\n\ninvasion plasmid antigen\n\n\n\n\nIS\n\ninsertion sequence\n\n\n\n\nivi\n\nin vivo‐induced\n\n\n\n\nKatP\n\ncatalase peroxidase\n\n\n\n\nLAA\n\nlocus of adhesion and autoaggregation\n\n\n\n\nLAMP\n\nloop mediated isothermal amplification\n\n\n\n\nLEE\n\nlocus of enterocyte effacement\n\n\n\n\nLT\n\nheat labile\n\n\n\n\nMGE\n\nmobile genetic element\n\n\n\n\nMLST\n\nmultilocus sequence typing\n\n\n\n\nMLVA\n\nmultilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis\n\n\n\n\nMPN\n\nmost probable number\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nMember State\n\n\n\n\nPAI\n\npathogenicity island\n\n\n\n\nPCR\n\npolymerase chain reaction\n\n\n\n\nPFGE\n\npulsed field gel electrophoresis\n\n\n\n\nSLT\n\nShiga like toxin\n\n\n\n\nSNP\n\nsingle nucleotide polymorphism\n\n\n\n\nST\n\nheat stable\n\n\n\n\nSTEC\n\nShiga toxin‐producing E. coli\n\n\n\n\nStx\n\nShiga toxin\n\n\n\n\ntEPEC\n\ntypical EPEC\n\n\n\n\nTESSy\n\nThe European Surveillance System\n\n\n\n\nTTSS\n\ntype III secretion system\n\n\n\n\nUI\n\nuncertainty interval\n\n\n\n\nUPEC\n\nuropathogenic Escherichia coli\n\n\n\n\nUTI\n\nurinary tract infection\n\n\n\n\nVNTR\n\nvariable number tandem repeat\n\n\n\n\nVCA\n\nVero cell assay\n\n\n\n\nVT\n\nVerocytoxins\n\n\n\n\nVTEC\n\nverotoxin‐producing E. coli\n\n\n\n\nUI\n\nuncertainty interval\n\n\n\n\nUTI\n\nurinary tract infection\n\n\n\n\nVNTR\n\nvariable number tandem repeat\n\n\n\n\nwgMLST\n\nwhole genome MLST\n\n\n\n\nWGS\n\nwhole genome sequencing\n\n\n\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n\n\nWHO‐FERG\n\nWorld Health Organization's foodborne disease burden epidemiology reference group\n\n\n\n\nWPR\n\nWestern Pacific Region\n\n\n"

        "summary": "According to Article 12 of Regulation ( ) No 396/2005,   has reviewed the maximum residue levels ( s) currently established at European level for the pesticide active substance terbuthylazine. To assess the occurrence of terbuthylazine residues in plants, processed commodities, rotational crops and livestock,   considered the conclusions derived in the framework of Commission Regulation ( ) No 33/2008 as well as the European authorisations reported by Member States (including the supporting residues data). Based on the assessment of the available data,   proposals were derived and a consumer risk assessment was carried out. Although no apparent risk to consumers was identified, some information required by the regulatory framework was missing. Hence, the consumer risk assessment is considered indicative only and some   proposals derived by   still require further consideration by risk managers.",
        "full-text": "Terbuthylazine was approved on 1 January 2012 by means of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 820/2011 in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 and amending the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 and Commission Decision 2008/934/EC, pending the submission of confirmatory information as regards further studies (among other issues) on the groundwater exposure assessment for the metabolites (EFSA, 2011). Following evaluation of the confirmatory data (EFSA, 2016), the European Commission requested EFSA to organise a peer review of the confirmatory data to conclude on the consumer risk assessment of groundwater metabolites (EFSA, 2017). The confirmatory data assessment (EFSA, 2019a), taking into consideration the scientific opinion of the EFSA Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (EFSA PPR Panel, 2019) on the setting of health‐based reference values for metabolites, was published recently.As the active substance was approved after the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 on 2 September 2008, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to provide a reasoned opinion on the review of the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for that active substance in compliance with Article 12(1) of the aforementioned regulation.As the basis for the MRL review, on 16 November 2017 EFSA initiated the collection of data for this active substance. In a first step, Member States were invited to submit by 16 December 2017 their national Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) in a standardised way, in the format of specific GAP forms, allowing the designated rapporteur Member State Spain to identify the critical GAPs in the format of a specific GAP overview file. Subsequently, Member States were requested to provide residue data supporting the critical GAPs, within a period of 1 month, by 6 April 2018. On the basis of all the data submitted by Member States and by the EU Reference Laboratories for Pesticides Residues (EURLs), EFSA asked the RMS to complete the Pesticide Residues Overview File (PROFile) and to prepare a supporting evaluation report. The PROFile and evaluation report and updated GAP overview file were provided by the RMS to EFSA on 13 June 2018. Subsequently, EFSA performed the completeness check of these documents with the RMS. The outcome of this exercise including the clarifications provided by the RMS, if any, was compiled in the completeness check. It is acknowledged that the potential relevance of the parallel assessment of the confirmatory data on the MRL review resulted in a delay in finalisation of this reasoned opinion.Based on the information provided by the RMS, Member States and the EURL, and taking into account the conclusions derived by EFSA in the framework of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008, EFSA prepared in August–September 2019 a draft reasoned opinion, which was circulated to Member States for consultation via a written procedure. Comments received by 31 October 2019 were considered during the finalisation of this reasoned opinion. The following conclusions are derived.The metabolism of terbuthylazine in plant was investigated in primary and rotational crops. According to the results of the metabolism studies, the residue definition for enforcement is proposed as terbuthylazine (MT0) only and for risk assessment as ‘sum of terbuthylazine and metabolites MT1 (desethyl‐terbuthylazine) and MT14 (Terbuthylazine‐desethyl‐2‐hydroxy), expressed as terbuthylazine’ for primary and rotational crops. Standard hydrolysis studies are not available and were not considered necessary because residues of terbuthylazine in primary crops were below limit of quantification (LOQ).A sufficiently validated analytical method is available for the enforcement of the proposed residue definition in dry matrices at the LOQ of 0.02 mg/kg. For high water and high oil content commodities analytical methods at a LOQ of 0.02 mg/kg are available however confirmatory methods and ILVs are still required (data gap). According to the EURLs, the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg is achievable by using the QuEChERS method in routine analyses.The available data are considered sufficient to derive MRL proposals as well as risk assessment values for all commodities under evaluation, except for sweet corn and lupins/lupini beans, sunflower and cotton seeds where tentative MRLs are derived. Considering the general data gap identified for confirmatory methods and independent laboratory validations (ILVs) for high water and high oil content plant commodities and for storage stability studies for high water (MT0, MT1 and MT14) and high protein (MT0, MT1) content commodities (data gap), MRLs for all commodities belonging to these categories are tentative.Tentative MRLs were also derived for maize forage, common millet forage, maize stover and sorghum stover in view of the future need to set MRLs in feed items.While residue definitions for rotational crops can be derived, the available succeeding crop supervised trials are insufficient to derive MRLs for rotational crops noting that uptake of terbuthylazine, MT1 and MT14 were not reported in edible commodities (fully ripe sunflower seeds) at a plant‐back interval of 407 days. Therefore, specific MRLs in rotational crops are not required, provided Member States will take adequate risk mitigation measures (e.g. define plant‐back interval of at least one year or specify deep ploughing (more than 20 cm soil mixing) to dilute soil concentrations).Terbuthylazine is authorised for use on crops that might be fed to livestock. Livestock dietary burden calculations were therefore performed for different groups of livestock according to OECD guidance. The dietary burdens were calculated for all animal commodities, whereby cattle (all) and dairy cattle were found to exceed the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg dry matter (DM). Behaviour of residues was therefore assessed in these groups of livestock.The metabolism of terbuthylazine residues in livestock was investigated in lactating goats and laying hens at dose rate covering the maximum dietary burdens estimated based on total radioactive residues in this review. In the ruminant metabolism study, metabolites were only characterised in milk and not in animal tissues (data gap). Based on the results of the metabolism study, in milk the following residue definitions are proposed for enforcement: sum of terbuthylazine and MT1, expressed as terbuthylazine and for risk assessment: sum of terbuthylazine and MT1, expressed as terbuthylazine. Since at the calculated dietary burden no residues are expected in this commodity, the MRL can be derived at the LOQ.For all other tissues, in the absence of a full characterisation of the total radioactive residue (TRR) in the available metabolism study, it is not possible to derive a residue definition for enforcement and risk assessment nor MRL proposals.An analytical liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) method was fully validated for the determination of terbuthylazine in all animal tissues, milk and eggs, with a LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg. According to the EURLs, terbuthylazine can be monitored in milk, meat, fish and honey with a screening detection limit (SDL) of 0.0025 mg/kg by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC–MS) and a method for routine analysis of terbuthylazine and MT1 at a LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg in milk was also provided by the EURLs. Pending the submission of a fully validated method (data gap) for the enforcement of MT1 in milk, the MRL in milk is tentatively proposed at a combined LOQ of 0.02 mg/kg.Storage stability studies for ruminant tissues and milk are still required (data gap).Chronic and acute consumer exposure resulting from the authorised uses reported in the framework of this review were calculated using revision 2 and 3.0 of the EFSA Pesticide Residues Overview File (PRIMo). When using PRIMo rev. 3.0, the highest chronic exposure represented 35% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI) (NL toddler) and the highest acute exposure amounted to 31% of the acute reference dose (ARfD) (cattle milk).Regulation (EC) No 396/20051 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Regulation’) establishes the rules governing the setting and the review of pesticide maximum residue levels (MRLs) at European level. Article 12(1) of that Regulation stipulates that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) shall provide within 12 months from the date of the inclusion or non‐inclusion of an active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC2 a reasoned opinion on the review of the existing MRLs for that active substance.As terbuthylazine was approved on 1 January 2012 by means of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 820/20113 in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/20094 and amending the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/20115 and Commission Decision 2008/934/EC6, EFSA initiated the review of all existing MRLs for that active substance.By way of background information, in the framework of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/20087 Terbuthylazine was evaluated by United Kingdom, designated as rapporteur Member State (RMS). Subsequently, a peer review on the initial evaluation of the RMS was conducted by EFSA, leading to the conclusions as set out in the EFSA output (EFSA, 2011). The approval of Terbuthylazine is restricted to uses as herbicide only. Furthermore, according to the provisions of the approval regulation, confirmatory information was requested, among others, regarding consumer risk assessment of groundwater metabolites. The confirmatory data assessment on groundwater metabolites, on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of terbuthylazine as a herbicide on maize and sorghum (EFSA, 2019a), taking into account the scientific opinion of the EFSA Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (EFSA PPR Panel, 2019) on the setting of health‐based reference values for metabolites of the active substance terbuthylazine was finalised recently by EFSA.According to the legal provisions, EFSA shall base its reasoned opinion in particular on the relevant assessment report prepared under Directive 91/414/EEC repealed by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. It should be noted, however, that, in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, only a few representative uses are evaluated, whereas MRLs set out in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 should accommodate all uses authorised within the European Union (EU), and uses authorised in third countries that have a significant impact on international trade. The information included in the assessment report prepared under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 is therefore insufficient for the assessment of all existing MRLs for a given active substance.To gain an overview of the pesticide residues data that have been considered for the setting of the existing MRLs, EFSA developed the Pesticide Residues Overview File (PROFile). The PROFile is an inventory of all pesticide residues data relevant to the risk assessment and MRL setting for a given active substance. This includes data on:\n\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in primary crops;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in processed commodities;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in rotational crops;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in livestock commodities;\nthe analytical methods for enforcement of the proposed MRLs.\nAs the basis for the MRL review, on 16 November 2017 EFSA initiated the collection of data for this active substance. In a first step, Member States were invited to submit by 16 December 2017 their Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) that are authorised nationally, in a standardised way, in the format of specific GAP forms. In the framework of this consultation, eight Member States provided feedback on their national authorisations of terbuthylazine. Based on the GAP data submitted, the designated RMS Spain was asked to identify the critical GAPs to be further considered in the assessment, in the format of a specific GAP overview file. Subsequently, in a second step, Member States were requested to provide residue data supporting the critical GAPs by 6 April 2018.On the basis of all the data submitted by Member States and the EU Reference Laboratories for Pesticides Residues (EURL), EFSA asked Spain to complete the PROFile and to prepare a supporting evaluation report. The PROFile and the supporting evaluation report and updated GAP overview file, were submitted to EFSA on 13 June 2018. Subsequently, EFSA performed the completeness check of these documents with the RMS. The outcome of this exercise including the clarifications provided by the RMS, if any, was compiled in the completeness check report.Considering all the available information, EFSA prepared in August‐September 2019 a draft reasoned opinion, which was circulated to Member States for commenting via a written procedure. All comments received by 31 October 2019 were considered by EFSA during the finalisation of the reasoned opinion.The evaluation report submitted by the RMS (Spain, 2018), taking into account also the information provided by Member States during the collection of data, and the EURL report on analytical methods (EURL, 2018) are considered as main supporting documents to this reasoned opinion and, thus, made publicly available.In addition, further supporting documents to this reasoned opinion are the completeness check report (EFSA, 2019) and the Member States consultation report (EFSA, 2019a). These reports are developed to address all issues raised in the course of the review, from the initial completeness check to the reasoned opinion. Furthermore, the exposure calculations for all crops reported in the framework of this review performed using the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) and the PROFile as well as the GAP overview file listing all authorised uses are key supporting documents and made publicly available as background documents to this reasoned opinion. A screenshot of the report sheet of the PRIMo is presented in Appendix C.According to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, EFSA shall provide a reasoned opinion on:\n\nthe inclusion of the active substance in Annex IV to the Regulation, when appropriate;\nthe necessity of setting new MRLs for the active substance or deleting/modifying existing MRLs set out in Annex II or III of the Regulation;\nthe inclusion of the recommended MRLs in Annex II or III to the Regulation;\nthe setting of specific processing factors as referred to in Article 20(2) of the Regulation.\nTerbuthylazine is the ISO common name for N2‐tert‐butyl‐6‐chloro‐N4‐ethyl‐1,3,5‐triazine‐2,4‐diamine (IUPAC).The chemical structure of the active substance and its main metabolites are reported in Appendix F.The EU MRLs for terbuthylazine are established in Annex IIIA of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. Codex maximum residue limits (CXLs) for terbuthylazine are not available. There are no MRL changes occurred since the entry into force of the Regulation mentioned above. For the purpose of this MRL review, all the uses of terbuthylazine currently authorised within the EU as submitted by the Member States during the GAP collection, have been reported by the RMS in the GAP overview file. The critical GAPs (cGAP) identified in the GAP overview file were then summarised in the PROFile and considered in the assessment. The details of the authorised cGAPs for terbuthylazine are given in Appendix A. No import tolerances were reported by the RMS.EFSA has based its assessment on the following documents:\n\nthe PROFile submitted by the RMS;\nthe evaluation report accompanying the PROFile (Spain, 2018);\nthe draft assessment report (DAR) prepared under Council Directive 91/414/EEC (United Kingdom, 2007);\nthe additional report to the DAR and its final addendum prepared under Council Directive 91/414/EEC (United Kingdom, 2010a,b);\nthe conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance terbuthylazine (EFSA, 2011);\nThe assessment is performed in accordance with the legal provisions of the uniform principles for evaluation and authorisation of plant protection products as set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/20118 and the currently applicable guidance documents relevant for the consumer risk assessment of pesticide residues (European Commission, 1997a,b,c,d,e,f,g, 2000, 2010a,b, 2017; OECD, 2011, 2013).More detailed information on the available data and on the conclusions derived by EFSA can be retrieved from the list of end points reported in Appendix B.Terbuthylazine is authorised for use on maize, sorghum, common millet forage and maize forage that might be fed to livestock. Livestock dietary burden calculations were therefore performed for different groups of livestock according to OECD guidance (OECD, 2013), which has now also been agreed upon at European level. The input values for all relevant commodities are summarised in Appendix D. The dietary burdens calculated for cattle (all) and dairy cattle were found to exceed the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg DM. Behaviour of residues was therefore assessed in these groups of livestock.It is highlighted that for several feed items (sugar beet tops and roots, potato tuber, wheat and barley grain and straw, rape seed seeds and straw and sunflower seeds) residue data from rotational field trials were available (see Appendix B.1.2.2.b). Although the number of rotational crop field trials is insufficient, the data show that residues in rotational crops are not expected to have a major impact on the outcome of the dietary burden considering the overwhelming contribution of maize forage which is derived from primary crops.The metabolism of terbuthylazine residues in livestock was investigated in dairy cow and beef cattle at dose rates covering the maximum dietary burdens calculated in this review (United Kingdom, 2007). In the studies terbuthylazine was radiolabelled in the triazine ring of the molecule and they were assessed in the framework of the peer review (United Kingdom, 2010a,b; EFSA, 2011).The study performed on dairy and beef cattle indicates a significant transfer of residues to milk and tissues. Highest residue levels were found in liver, kidney and fat (0.92 mg eq./kg, 0.59 mg eq/kg and 0.15 mg eq/kg TRR) whilst lower transfer is expected in milk and muscle (0.082 mg eq./kg and 0.06 mg eq./kg TRR).Nevertheless, the study was considered as not appropriate to propose a residue definition during the peer review because no characterisation of metabolites was performed in animal tissues except in milk where MT1 and MT20 were identified as major metabolites (around 50% and 12.5% TRR) (EFSA, 2011). Since significant residues are expected in liver and kidney, a characterisation of metabolites in ruminant tissues is required (data gap).Although not required, a metabolism study with triazine ring‐labelled terbuthylazine in laying hen after multiple oral administration was provided during this review (Spain, 2018); however, this study was not peer reviewed. The study was evaluated in the context of this review considering a potential need for setting MRLs for poultry derived commodities in the future.The study performed on laying hen shows that terbuthylazine is extensively degraded in livestock matrix and was reported only in fat (5.4% TRR (0.158 mg eq/kg)). The highest TRR were found in liver (6.98 mg eq./kg), kidney (6.7 mg eq./kg), skin and fat (2.92 mg eq./kg) and lower levels in muscle (1.82 mg eq./kg).Radioactive residues were composed of several metabolites. The most predominant compounds are metabolite 3L ((43% TRR (0.78 mg eq/kg) in muscle; 47.2% TRR (0.21 mg eq/kg) in egg white; 42.5% TRR (0.42 mg eq/kg) in egg yolk; 14.7% TRR (0.43 mg eq/kg) in skin/fat and 5.2% TRR (0.363 mg eq/kg) in liver)) and metabolite MT1 ((49.3%TRR (1.44 mg eq/kg) in skin/fat; 12.8% TRR (0.06 mg eq/kg) in egg white; 39.5% TRR (0.39 mg eq/kg) in egg yolk; 12.7% TRR (0.23 mg eq/kg) in muscle and 1.6% TRR (0.112 mg eq/kg) in liver)). All other identified metabolites were present at lower levels (< 10% TRR).Considering that higher residues (mg eq./kg TRR) were reported in fat than in muscle, terbuthylazine residues are considered fat soluble.Based on the results of the metabolism study on ruminants, the following residue definition is proposed in milk for enforcement: sum of terbuthylazine and MT1, expressed as terbuthylazine and for risk assessment: sum of terbuthylazine and MT1, expressed as terbuthylazine. As no residues are expected in this commodity at the calculated dietary burden, the MRL can be derived at the LOQ.For all other tissues, in the absence of a full characterization of the TRR in the available metabolism study, it is not possible to derive a residue definition for enforcement and risk assessment nor MRL proposals.An analytical LC–MS/MS method was fully validated for the determination of terbuthylazine in all animal tissues, milk and eggs, with a LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg (Spain, 2018). According to the EURLs, terbuthylazine can be monitored in milk, meat, fish and honey with a screening detection limit (SDL) of 0.0025 mg/kg by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC–MS). A method for routine analysis of terbuthylazine and MT1 at a LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg in milk was provided by the EURLs (EURLs, 2018).Pending the submission of a fully validated method for the enforcement of metabolite MT1 in milk, the MRL in milk is tentatively proposed at a combined LOQ of 0.02 mg/kg.The storage stability of metabolites present in poultry liver and egg white were evaluated by comparing chromatograms following storage for two weeks, six and 32 months at −18°C. Whereby it was reported that the chromatographic pattern did not change significantly, this indicative study cannot be considered as a valid storage stability study for animal tissues. Therefore, a storage stability study in ruminant tissues and milk is required (data gap).In the framework of this review, only the uses of terbuthylazine reported by the RMS in Appendix A were considered.As the data collection of terbuthylazine was initiated before 1 February 2018, consumer exposure was calculated with PRIMo model rev. 2 (EFSA, 2007) and additionally calculations using PRIMo model version rev. 3.0 (EFSA, 2018).Chronic and acute exposure calculations for all crops reported in the framework of this review were therefore performed using revisions 2 and 3.0 of the EFSA PRIMo. Input values for the exposure calculations were derived in compliance with the decision tree reported in Appendix E. Hence, for those commodities where a (tentative) MRL could be derived by EFSA in the framework of this review, input values were derived according to the internationally agreed methodologies (FAO, 2009). For bovine tissues for which residue definitions, MRLs and risk assessment values could not be derived, the existing MRL was considered for an indicative calculation. All input values included in the exposure calculations are summarised in Appendix D.The exposure values calculated were compared with the toxicological reference values for terbuthylazine, derived by EFSA (2011). With PRIMo version 2, the highest chronic exposure was calculated for FR toddler, representing 21.6% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI) with milk representing the highest contributor (19.8% ADI), and the highest acute exposure was calculated for milk and cream, representing 31.1% of the acute reference dose (ARfD). With PRIMo version 3.0 the highest chronic exposure was calculated for NL toddler, representing 35% of the ADI with milk representing the highest contributor (30% ADI), and the highest acute exposure was calculated for cattle milk, representing 31% of the ARfD. These calculations indicate that the uses assessed under this review result in a consumer exposure lower than the toxicological reference values. Although (major) uncertainties remain due to the data gaps identified in the previous sections, this indicative exposure calculation did not indicate a risk to consumer's health.The metabolism of terbuthylazine in plant was investigated in primary and rotational crops. According to the results of the metabolism studies, the residue definition for enforcement is proposed as terbuthylazine (MT0) only and for risk assessment as ‘sum of terbuthylazine and metabolites MT1 (desethyl‐terbuthylazine) and MT14 (Terbuthylazine‐desethyl‐2‐hydroxy), expressed as terbuthylazine’ for primary and rotational crops. Standard hydrolysis studies are not available and were not considered necessary because residues of terbuthylazine in primary crops were below LOQ.A sufficiently validated analytical method is available for the enforcement of the proposed residue definition in dry matrices at the LOQ of 0.02 mg/kg. For high water and high oil content commodities analytical methods at a LOQ of 0.02 mg/kg are available however confirmatory methods and ILVs are still required (data gap). According to the EURLs the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg is achievable by using the QuEChERS method in routine analyses.The available data are considered sufficient to derive MRL proposals as well as risk assessment values for all commodities under evaluation, except for sweet corn and lupins/lupini beans, sunflower and cotton seeds where tentative MRLs are derived. Considering the general data gap identified for confirmatory methods and ILVs for high water and high oil content plant commodities and for storage stability studies for high water (MT0, MT1 and MT14) and high protein (MT0, MT1) content commodities (data gap), MRLs for all commodities belonging to these categories are tentative.Tentative MRLs were also derived for maize forage, common millet forage, maize stover and sorghum stover in view of the future need to set MRLs in feed items.While residue definitions for rotational crops can be derived, the available succeeding crop supervised trials are insufficient to derive MRLs for rotational crops noting that uptake of terbuthylazine, MT1 and MT14 were not reported in edible commodities (fully ripe sunflower seeds) at a PBI of 407 days. Therefore, specific MRLs in rotational crops are not required, provided Member States will take adequate risk mitigation measures (e.g. define PBI of at least one year or specify deep ploughing (more than 20 cm soil mixing) to dilute soil concentrations).Terbuthylazine is authorised for use on crops that might be fed to livestock. Livestock dietary burden calculations were therefore performed for different groups of livestock according to OECD guidance. The dietary burdens were calculated for all animal commodities, whereby cattle (all) and dairy cattle were found to exceed the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg DM. Behaviour of residues was therefore assessed in these groups of livestock.The metabolism of terbuthylazine residues in livestock was investigated in lactating goats and laying hens at dose rate covering the maximum dietary burdens estimated based on total radioactive residues in this review. In the ruminant metabolism study, metabolites were only characterised in milk and not in animal tissues (data gap). Based on the results of the metabolism study, in milk the following residue definitions are proposed for enforcement: sum of terbuthylazine and MT1, expressed as terbuthylazine and for risk assessment: sum of terbuthylazine and MT1, expressed as terbuthylazine. Since at the calculated dietary burden no residues are expected in this commodity, the MRL can be derived at the LOQ.For all other tissues, in the absence of a full characterization of the TRR in the available metabolism study, it is not possible to derive a residue definition for enforcement and risk assessment nor MRL proposals.An analytical LC–MS/MS method was fully validated for the determination of terbuthylazine in all animal tissues, milk and eggs, with a LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg. According to the EURLs, terbuthylazine can be monitored in milk, meat, fish and honey with a SDL of 0.0025 mg/kg by LC–MS and a method for routine analysis of terbuthylazine and MT1 at a LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg in milk was also provided by the EURLs. Pending the submission of a fully validated method (data gap) for the enforcement of MT1 in milk, the MRL in milk is tentatively proposed at a combined LOQ of 0.02 mg/kg.Storage stability studies for ruminant tissues and milk are still required (data gap).Chronic and acute consumer exposure resulting from the authorised uses reported in the framework of this review were calculated using revision 2 and 3.0 of the EFSA PRIMo. When using PRIMo rev. 3.0, the highest chronic exposure represented 35% of the ADI (NL toddler) and the highest acute exposure amounted to 31% of the ARfD (cattle milk).MRL recommendations were derived in compliance with the decision tree reported in Appendix E of the reasoned opinion (see Table 1). All MRL values listed as ‘Recommended’ in the table are sufficiently supported by data and are therefore proposed for inclusion in Annex II to the Regulation. The remaining MRL values listed in the table are not recommended for inclusion in Annex II because they require further consideration by risk managers (see Table 1 footnotes for details). Particularly, some tentative MRLs need to be confirmed by the following data:\n\nA confirmatory method and an ILV for the method for enforcement in high water and high oil content plant commodities.\nA representative study investigating storage stability of terbuthylazine in high water (terbuthylazine, MT1 and MT14) and high protein (terbuthylazine and MT1) content commodities (this data gap is applicable to sweet corn and lupins/lupini beans and to animal commodities as forage was the main contributor of the livestock exposure).\nAdditional residue trials on lupins/lupini beans and maize stover, supporting the critical GAPs of terbuthylazine on lupins/lupini beans and maize (this data gap is also relevant for animal commodities).\nA representative metabolism study to characterise metabolites in ruminant tissues.\nDepending on from the results of the required metabolism study, representative feeding studies in ruminants supported by storage stability information might also be required.\nA fully validated method for enforcement for metabolite M1 in milk.\nA representative storage stability study in ruminant tissues and milk.\nIt is highlighted, however, that some of the MRLs derived result from a GAP in one climatic zone only, whereas other GAPs reported by the RMS were not fully supported by data. EFSA therefore identified the following data gaps which are not expected to impact on the validity of the MRLs derived but which might have an impact on national authorisations:\n\nadditional residue trials on maize forage and sorghum stover supporting the critical SEU outdoor GAP;\nrepresentative rotational crop field studies at shorter PBIs (30–90 days), for small grain (cereals) also at the longest PBI, in additional crop groups (leafy vegetables, brassica vegetables and fruit and fruiting vegetables), with reported storage conditions (time and temperature) of samples prior to analysis.\nIf the above‐reported data gaps are not addressed in the future, Member States are recommended to withdraw or modify the relevant authorisations at national level.Pending the submission of the rotational crop field studies, Member States are recommended to take adequate risk mitigation measures (e.g. define PBI of at least one year or specify deep ploughing (more than 20 cm soil mixing) to dilute soil concentrations noting that a ploughing depth of 30 cm reduces soil residues by a factor of 1.5 and a ploughing depth of 40 cm by 50%) in order to avoid significant residues to occur in rotational crops.Minor deficiencies were also identified in the assessment however these deficiencies are not expected to impact either on the validity of the MRLs derived or on the national authorisations. The following data are therefore considered desirable but not essential:\n\na representative metabolism study on oil seeds performed at the early post‐emerging growth stage;\na representative storage stability study for metabolite MT14 in maize and sorghum stover;\nIt is acknowledged that an assessment of consumer exposure through drinking water resulting from groundwater metabolites was performed by EFSA during the peer review of confirmatory data. This information is available to risk managers in the EFSA conclusion on the confirmatory data (EFSA, 2019a) and it was not assessed in the present review (Table 1).\n\n\n\n\na.i.\n\nactive ingredient\n\n\n\n\na.s.\n\nactive substance\n\n\n\n\nADI\n\nacceptable daily intake\n\n\n\n\nARfD\n\nacute reference dose\n\n\n\n\nBBCH\n\ngrowth stages of mono‐ and dicotyledonous plants\n\n\n\n\nbw\n\nbody weight\n\n\n\n\nCF\n\nconversion factor for enforcement residue definition to risk assessment residue definition\n\n\n\n\ncGAP\n\ncritical GAP\n\n\n\n\nCXL\n\ncodex maximum residue limit\n\n\n\n\nDAR\n\ndraft assessment report\n\n\n\n\nDAT\n\ndays after treatment\n\n\n\n\nDB\n\ndietary burden\n\n\n\n\nDM\n\ndry matter\n\n\n\n\nDT90\n\nperiod required for 90% dissipation (define method of estimation)\n\n\n\n\nEMS\n\nevaluating Member State\n\n\n\n\neq\n\nresidue expressed as a.s. equivalent\n\n\n\n\nEURLs\n\nEuropean Union Reference Laboratories for Pesticide Residues (former CRLs)\n\n\n\n\nFAO\n\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nGC‐NPD\n\ngas chromatography with nitrogen/phosphorous detector\n\n\n\n\nHR\n\nhighest residue\n\n\n\n\nIEDI\n\ninternational estimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nIESTI\n\ninternational estimated short‐term intake\n\n\n\n\nILV\n\nindependent laboratory validation\n\n\n\n\nInChiKey\n\nInternational Chemical Identifier Key\n\n\n\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organisation for Standardization\n\n\n\n\nIUPAC\n\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n\n\n\n\nLC–MS/MS\n\nliquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nLOD\n\nlimit of detection\n\n\n\n\nLOQ\n\nlimit of quantification\n\n\n\n\nMo\n\nmonitoring\n\n\n\n\nMRL\n\nmaximum residue level\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nMember States\n\n\n\n\nNEDI\n\nnational estimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nNESTI\n\nnational estimated short‐term intake\n\n\n\n\nNEU\n\nnorthern European Union\n\n\n\n\nNTMDI\n\nnational theoretical maximum daily intake\n\n\n\n\nOECD\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development\n\n\n\n\nPBI\n\nplant‐back interval\n\n\n\n\nPEC\n\nPredicted Environmental Concentration\n\n\n\n\nPF\n\nprocessing factor\n\n\n\n\nPHI\n\npreharvest interval\n\n\n\n\nPow\n\npartition coefficient between n‐octanol and water\n\n\n\n\nPRIMo\n\n(EFSA) Pesticide Residues Intake Model\n\n\n\n\nPROFile\n\n(EFSA) Pesticide Residues Overview File\n\n\n\n\nQqQ\n\ntriple quadrupole\n\n\n\n\nQ‐TOF\n\nquadrupole time‐of‐flight\n\n\n\n\nQuEChERS\n\nQuick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (analytical method)\n\n\n\n\nRA\n\nrisk assessment\n\n\n\n\nRD\n\nresidue definition\n\n\n\n\nRMS\n\nrapporteur Member State\n\n\n\n\nSANCO\n\nDirectorate‐General for Health and Consumers\n\n\n\n\nSC\n\nsuspension concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSDL\n\nscreening detection limit\n\n\n\n\nSE\n\nsuspo‐emulsion\n\n\n\n\nSEU\n\nsouthern European Union\n\n\n\n\nSMILES\n\nsimplified molecular‐input line‐entry system\n\n\n\n\nSTMR\n\nsupervised trials median residue\n\n\n\n\nTMDI\n\ntheoretical maximum daily intake\n\n\n\n\nTRR\n\ntotal radioactive residue\n\n\n\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n"

        "summary": "According to Article 12 of Regulation ( ) No 396/2005,   has reviewed the maximum residue levels ( s) currently established at European level for the pesticide active substance fluxapyroxad. To assess the occurrence of fluxapyroxad residues in plants, processed commodities, rotational crops and livestock,   considered the conclusions derived in the framework of Commission Regulation ( ) No 188/2011, the  s established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission as well as the import tolerances and European authorisations reported by Member States (including the supporting residues data). Based on the assessment of the available data,   proposals were derived and a consumer risk assessment was carried out. Although no apparent risk to consumers was identified, some information required by the regulatory framework was missing. Hence, the consumer risk assessment is considered indicative only and some   proposals derived by   still require further consideration by risk managers.",
        "full-text": "Fluxapyroxad was approved on 1 January 2013 by means of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 589/2012 in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as amended by Commission Implementing Regulations (EU) No 540/2011 and 541/2011.As the active substance was approved after the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 on 2 September 2008, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to provide a reasoned opinion on the review of the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for that active substance in compliance with Article 12(1) of the aforementioned regulation.As the basis for the MRL review, on 15 June 2018, EFSA initiated the collection of data for this active substance. In a first step, Member States were invited to submit by 16 July 2018 their national Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) in a standardised way, in the format of specific GAP forms, allowing the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS), France, to identify the critical GAPs in the format of a specific GAP overview file. Subsequently, Member States were requested to provide residue data supporting the critical GAPs, within a period of 1 month, by 19 October 2018. On the basis of all the data submitted by Member States and by the EU Reference Laboratories for Pesticides Residues (EURLs), EFSA asked the RMS to complete the Pesticide Residues Overview File (PROFile) and to prepare a supporting evaluation report. The PROFile and evaluation report, together with Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) calculations and an updated GAP overview file were provided by the RMS to EFSA on 19 December 2018. Subsequently, EFSA performed the completeness check of these documents with the RMS. The outcome of this exercise including the clarifications provided by the RMS, if any, was compiled in the completeness check report.Based on the information provided by the RMS, Member States and the EURLs, and taking into account the conclusions derived by EFSA in the framework of Commission Regulation (EU) No 188/2011 and the MRLs established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, EFSA prepared in October 2019 a draft reasoned opinion, which was circulated to Member States for consultation via a written procedure. Comments received by 20 November 2019 were considered during the finalisation of this reasoned opinion. The following conclusions are derived.The metabolism of fluxapyroxad in plant was investigated in primary and rotational crops. According to the results of the metabolism studies, the residue definition for enforcement and risk assessment can be proposed as fluxapyroxad. These residue definitions are also applicable to processed commodities. Fully validated analytical methods are available for the enforcement of the proposed residue definition in all four main plant matrices at the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.01 mg/kg. According to the EURLs, the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg is achievable by using the QuEChERS method in routine analyses.The available data on primary crops are considered sufficient to derive (tentative) MRL proposals as well as risk assessment values for all commodities under evaluation, except for garlic, onions and shallots where data were insufficient to derive MRLs.MRLs and risk assessment values considering a worst‐case scenario reflecting crop failure (PBI of 30 days) were also derived for rotational crops on a tentative basis. For garlic, onions and shallots, the (tentative) MRL and risk assessment values derived are based on the results of the rotational field trials on roots, since no residue trials on primary uses were available. For fruiting vegetables and pulses and oilseeds, the tentative MRLs are based on the primary uses only, since representative of these crop groups was not assessed in the rotational crop field studies.Since the rotational crop field studies were underdosed compared to the total predicted environmental concentration in soil (PECsoil total) for the authorised uses in annual crops, the possible occurrence of residues of fluxapyroxad at levels higher than the derived (tentative) MRLs, following multiannual applications, cannot be excluded. Therefore, Member States granting an authorisation should request additional rotational crop field studies conducted with application rates that cover the plateau background concentrations for these crops. Pending the submission of these studies, Member States are recommended to implement appropriate mitigation measures in order to avoid exceedances of the derived MRLs.Fluxapyroxad is authorised for use on crops that might be fed to livestock. Livestock dietary burden calculations were therefore performed for different groups of livestock according to OECD guidance. The dietary burdens calculated for all groups of livestock were found to exceed the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg dry matter (DM). Behaviour of residues was therefore assessed in all commodities of animal origin.The metabolism of fluxapyroxad residues in livestock was investigated in lactating goats and laying hens at dose rate covering the maximum dietary burdens calculated in this review. According to the results of these studies, the residue definitions were proposed for enforcement as fluxapyroxad only, and for risk assessment as sum of fluxapyroxad and metabolite M700F008, expressed as parent equivalent. An analytical method for the enforcement of the proposed residue definition at the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg in all animal tissues and 0.001 mg/kg in milk and eggs is available. According to the EURLs screening data for commodities of animal origin show that fluxapyroxad can be monitored in meat with a screening detection limit (SDL) of 0.0025 mg/kg and in milk with an SDL of 0.005 mg/kg.Livestock feeding studies on animal were used to derive (tentative) MRL and risk assessment values in milk, eggs and tissues of ruminants and poultry. Since extrapolation from ruminants to pigs is acceptable, results of the livestock feeding study on ruminants were relied upon to derive the (tentative) MRL and risk assessment values in pigs.Chronic and acute consumer exposure resulting from the authorised uses reported in the framework of this review was calculated using revision 3 of the EFSA PRIMo. For those commodities where data were insufficient to derive an MRL, EFSA considered the existing EU MRL for an indicative calculation. The highest chronic exposure was calculated for Dutch toddler, representing 44% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI), and the highest acute exposure was calculated for celeries, representing 77% of the acute reference dose (ARfD).Apart from the MRLs evaluated in the framework of this review, internationally recommended Codex MRLs (CXLs) have also been established for fluxapyroxad. Additional calculations of the consumer exposure, considering these CXLs were performed, the highest chronic exposure was calculated for Dutch toddler representing 55% of the ADI and the highest acute exposure was calculated for celeries, representing 77% of the ARfD.Although uncertainties remain due to the data gaps identified, these indicative exposure calculations did not indicate a risk to consumer's health.Regulation (EC) No 396/20051 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Regulation’) establishes the rules governing the setting and the review of pesticide maximum residue levels (MRLs) at European level. Article 12(1) of that Regulation stipulates that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) shall provide, within 12 months from the date of the inclusion or non‐inclusion of an active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC2 a reasoned opinion on the review of the existing MRLs for that active substance.As fluxapyroxad was approved on 1 January 2013 by means of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 589/20123 in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107/20094 as amended by Commission Implementing Regulations (EU) No 540/20115 and 541/20116, EFSA initiated the review of all existing MRLs for that active substance.By way of background information, in the framework of Commission Regulation (EU) No 188/20117, Fluxapyroxad was evaluated by France, designated as rapporteur Member State (RMS). Subsequently, a peer review on the initial evaluation of the RMS was conducted by EFSA, leading to the conclusions as set out in the EFSA scientific output (EFSA, 2012).According to the legal provisions, EFSA shall base its reasoned opinion in particular on the relevant assessment report prepared under Directive 91/414/EEC repealed by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. It should be noted, however, that, in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, only a few representative uses are evaluated, whereas MRLs set out in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 should accommodate all uses authorised within the European Union (EU), and uses authorised in third countries that have a significant impact on international trade. The information included in the assessment report prepared under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 is therefore insufficient for the assessment of all existing MRLs for a given active substance.To gain an overview of the pesticide residues data that have been considered for the setting of the existing MRLs, EFSA developed the Pesticide Residues Overview File (PROFile). The PROFile is an inventory of all pesticide residues data relevant to the risk assessment and MRL setting for a given active substance. This includes data on:\n\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in primary crops;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in processed commodities;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in rotational crops;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in livestock commodities;\nthe analytical methods for enforcement of the proposed MRLs.\nAs the basis for the MRL review, on 15 June 2018, EFSA initiated the collection of data for this active substance. In a first step, Member States were invited to submit by 16 July 2018 their Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) that are authorised nationally, in a standardised way, in the format of specific GAP forms. In the framework of this consultation, 18 Member States provided feedback on their national authorisations of fluxapyroxad. Based on the GAP data submitted, the designated RMS France was asked to identify the critical GAPs to be further considered in the assessment, in the format of specific GAP overview file. Subsequently, in a second step, Member States were requested to provide residue data supporting the critical GAPs by 19 October 2018.On the basis of all the data submitted by Member States and the EU Reference Laboratories for Pesticides Residues (EURLs), EFSA asked France to complete the PROFile and to prepare a supporting evaluation report. The PROFile and the supporting evaluation report, together with the Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) calculations and an updated GAP overview file, were submitted to EFSA on 19 December 2018. Subsequently, EFSA performed the completeness check of these documents with the RMS. The outcome of this exercise including the clarifications provided by the RMS, if any, was compiled in the completeness check report. During this completeness check, an additional PROFile was compiled to perform the calculation of MRLs in rotational crops.Considering all the available information and taking into account the MRLs established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) (i.e. codex maximum residue limit; CXLs), EFSA prepared in October 2019 a draft reasoned opinion, which was circulated to Member States for commenting via a written procedure. All comments received by 20 November 2019 were considered by EFSA during the finalisation of the reasoned opinion.The evaluation report submitted by the RMS (France, 2018), taking into account also the information provided by Member States during the collection of data, and the EURLs report on analytical methods (EURLs, 2018) are considered as main supporting documents to this reasoned opinion and, thus, made publicly available.In addition, further supporting documents to this reasoned opinion are the completeness check report (EFSA, 2019a) and the Member States consultation report (EFSA, 2019b). These reports are developed to address all issues raised in the course of the review, from the initial completeness check to the reasoned opinion. Furthermore, the exposure calculations for all crops reported in the framework of this review performed using the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) and the PROFiles as well as the GAP overview file listing all authorised uses and import tolerances are key supporting documents and made publicly available as background documents to this reasoned opinion. A screenshot of the report sheet of the PRIMo is presented in Appendix C.According to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, EFSA shall provide a reasoned opinion on:\n\nthe inclusion of the active substance in Annex IV to the Regulation, when appropriate;\nthe necessity of setting new MRLs for the active substance or deleting/modifying existing MRLs set out in Annex II or III of the Regulation;\nthe inclusion of the recommended MRLs in Annex II or III to the Regulation;\nthe setting of specific processing factors as referred to in Article 20(2) of the Regulation.\nFluxapyroxad is the ISO common name for 3‐(difluoromethyl)‐1‐methyl‐N‐(3′,4′,5′‐trifluorobiphenyl‐2‐yl)pyrazole‐4‐carboxamide (IUPAC). The chemical structure of the active substance and its main metabolites are reported in Appendix F.The EU MRLs for fluxapyroxad are established in Annexes IIIA of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. Codex maximum residue limits (CXLs) for fluxapyroxad were also established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC). An overview of the MRL changes that occurred since the entry into force of the Regulation mentioned above is provided below (Table 1).For the purpose of this MRL review, all the uses of fluxapyroxad currently authorised within the EU and in third countries as submitted by the Member States during the GAP collection, have been reported by the RMS in the GAP overview file. The critical GAPs identified in the GAP overview file were then summarised in the PROFile and considered in the assessment. The details of the authorised critical GAPs for fluxapyroxad are given in Appendix A.EFSA has based its assessment on the following documents:\n\nthe PROFile submitted by the RMS;\nthe additional PROFile prepared by EFSA for the calculation of MRLs in rotational crops;\nthe evaluation report accompanying the submitted PROFile (France, 2018);\nthe draft assessment report (DAR) and its addenda prepared under Council Directive 91/414/EEC (United Kingdom, 2011a,b);\nthe conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fluxapyroxad (EFSA, 2012);\nthe Joint Meeting on Pesticide residues (JMPR) Evaluation report (FAO, 2012, 2015);\nthe previous reasoned opinions on fluxapyroxad (EFSA, 2011, 2015b, 2016a, 2017).\nThe assessment is performed in accordance with the legal provisions of the uniform principles for evaluation and authorisation of plant protection products as set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/20118 and the currently applicable guidance documents relevant for the consumer risk assessment of pesticide residues (European Commission, 1997a–g, 2000, 2010a,b, 2017; OECD, 2011, 2013).More detailed information on the available data and on the conclusions derived by EFSA can be retrieved from the list of end points reported in Appendix B.Fluxapyroxad is authorised for use on crops that might be fed to livestock (e.g. cereals, sugar beets). Livestock dietary burden calculations were therefore performed for different groups of livestock according to OECD guidance (OECD, 2013), which has now also been agreed upon at European level. The input values for all relevant commodities are summarised in Appendix D. Since residues from rotational crop field studies could contribute to the dietary burden, combined residue from primary uses and from rotational crop field studies were combined and used as input values (see Appendix B.1.2.2.(c). According to this calculation, the main contributors to the dietary burden are the residue in wheat straw and rye straw from primary uses and potato (processed) from the combined residues of primary uses and rotational crop field studies. The dietary burdens calculated for all groups of livestock were found to exceed the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg dry matter (DM). Behaviour of residues was therefore assessed in all commodities of animal origin.In the framework of this review, only the uses of fluxapyroxad reported by the RMS in Appendix A were considered; however, the use of fluxapyroxad was previously also assessed by the JMPR (FAO, 2012, 2015). The CXLs, resulting from these assessments by JMPR and adopted by the CAC, are now international recommendations that need to be considered by European risk managers when establishing MRLs. To facilitate consideration of these CXLs by risk managers, the consumer exposure was calculated both with and without consideration of the existing CXLs.The metabolism of fluxapyroxad in plant was investigated in primary and rotational crops. According to the results of the metabolism studies, the residue definition for enforcement and risk assessment can be proposed as fluxapyroxad. These residue definitions are also applicable to processed commodities. Fully validated analytical methods are available for the enforcement of the proposed residue definition in all four main plant matrices at the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg. According to the EURLs, the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg is achievable by using the QuEChERS method in routine analyses.The available data on primary crops are considered sufficient to derive (tentative) MRL proposals as well as risk assessment values for all commodities under evaluation, except for garlic, onions and shallots where data were insufficient to derive MRLs.MRLs and risk assessment values considering a worst‐case scenario reflecting crop failure (PBI of 30 days) were also derived for rotational crops on a tentative basis. For garlic, onions and shallots, the (tentative) MRL and risk assessment values derived are based on the results of the rotational field trials on roots, since no residue trials on primary uses were available. For fruiting vegetables and pulses and oilseeds, the tentative MRLs are based on the primary uses only, since representative of these crop groups were not assessed in the rotational crop field studies.Since the rotational crop field studies were underdosed compared to the PECsoil total for the authorised uses in annual crops, the possible occurrence of residues of fluxapyroxad at levels higher than the derived (tentative) MRLs, following multiannual applications, cannot be excluded. Therefore, Member States granting an authorisation should request additional rotational crop field studies conducted with application rates that cover the plateau background concentrations for these crops. Pending the submission of these studies, Member States are recommended to implement appropriate mitigation measures in order to avoid exceedances of the derived MRLs.Fluxapyroxad is authorised for use on crops that might be fed to livestock. Livestock dietary burden calculations were therefore performed for different groups of livestock according to OECD guidance. The dietary burdens calculated for all groups of livestock were found to exceed the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg DM. Behaviour of residues was therefore assessed in all commodities of animal origin.The metabolism of fluxapyroxad residues in livestock was investigated in lactating goats and laying hens at dose rate covering the maximum dietary burdens calculated in this review. According to the results of these studies, the residue definitions were proposed for enforcement as fluxapyroxad only, and for risk assessment as sum of fluxapyroxad and metabolite M700F008, expressed as parent equivalent. An analytical method for the enforcement of the proposed residue definition at the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg in all animal tissues and 0.001 mg/kg in milk and eggs is available. According to the EURLs screening data for commodities of animal origin show that fluxapyroxad can be monitored in meat with an SDL of 0.0025 mg/kg and in milk with an SDL of 0.005 mg/kg.Livestock feeding studies on animal were used to derive (tentative) MRL and risk assessment values in milk, eggs and tissues of ruminants and poultry. Since extrapolation from ruminants to pigs is acceptable, results of the livestock feeding study on ruminants were relied upon to derive the (tentative) MRL and risk assessment values in pigs.Chronic and acute consumer exposure resulting from the authorised uses reported in the framework of this review was calculated using revision 3 of the EFSA PRIMo. For those commodities where data were insufficient to derive an MRL, EFSA considered the existing EU MRL for an indicative calculation. The highest chronic exposure was calculated for Dutch toddler, representing 44% of the ADI, and the highest acute exposure was calculated for celeries, representing 77% of the ARfD.Apart from the MRLs evaluated in the framework of this review, internationally recommended CXLs have also been established for fluxapyroxad. Additional calculations of the consumer exposure, considering these CXLs were performed, the highest chronic exposure was calculated for Dutch toddler representing 55% of the ADI and the highest acute exposure was calculated for celeries, representing 77% of the ARfD.Although uncertainties remain due to the data gaps identified in the previous sections, these indicative exposure calculations did not indicate a risk to consumer's health.MRL recommendations were derived in compliance with the decision tree reported in Appendix E of the reasoned opinion (see Table 2). All MRL values listed as ‘Recommended’ in the table are sufficiently supported by data and are therefore proposed for inclusion in Annex II to the Regulation. The remaining MRL values listed in the table are not recommended for inclusion in Annex II because they require further consideration by risk managers (see Table 2 footnotes for details). In particular some tentative MRLs need to be confirmed by the following data:\n\nResidue trials supporting GAPs on garlic, onions, shallots;\nA representative analytical method for herbal infusions from leaves and herbs and herbal infusions from roots.\nRotational crop field studies investigating the magnitude of residues in rotational crops covering the plateau concentration expected when fluxapyroxad is used according to the GAPs assessed in this MRL review (data gap relevant for all crops that can be grown in rotation).\nPending the submission of the rotational crop field studies, Member States are recommended to implement proper mitigation measures or to reconsider these uses in order to avoid exceedances of the derived MRLs.It is highlighted, however, that some of the MRLs derived result from a CXL or from a GAP in one climatic zone only, whereas other GAPs reported by the RMS were not fully supported by data. EFSA therefore identified the following data gaps which are not expected to impact on the validity of the MRLs derived but which might have an impact on national authorisations:\n\nAdditional residue trials supporting GAPs on apricots, peaches, carrots, Spring onions, cauliflowers, Brussels sprouts, lettuces and peas (without pods).\nIf the above reported data gaps are not addressed in the future, Member States are recommended to withdraw or modify the relevant authorisations at national level.\n\n\n\n\na.i.\n\nactive ingredient\n\n\n\n\na.s.\n\nactive substance\n\n\n\n\nADI\n\nacceptable daily intake\n\n\n\n\nARfD\n\nacute reference dose\n\n\n\n\nBBCH\n\ngrowth stages of mono‐ and dicotyledonous plants\n\n\n\n\nbw\n\nbody weight\n\n\n\n\nCAC\n\nCodex Alimentarius Commission\n\n\n\n\nCAS\n\nChemical Abstract Service\n\n\n\n\nCCPR\n\nCodex Committee on Pesticide Residues\n\n\n\n\nCF\n\nconversion factor for enforcement residue definition to risk assessment residue definition\n\n\n\n\nCXL\n\ncodex maximum residue limit\n\n\n\n\nDALA\n\ndays after last application\n\n\n\n\nDAR\n\ndraft assessment report\n\n\n\n\nDAT\n\ndays after treatment\n\n\n\n\nDB\n\ndietary burden\n\n\n\n\nDM\n\ndry matter\n\n\n\n\nDP\n\ndustable powder\n\n\n\n\nDT90\n\nperiod required for 90% dissipation (define method of estimation)\n\n\n\n\nEC\n\nemulsifiable concentrate\n\n\n\n\neq\n\nresidue expressed as a.s. equivalent\n\n\n\n\nEURLs\n\nEuropean Union Reference Laboratories for Pesticide Residues (former CRLs)\n\n\n\n\nFAO\n\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nGR\n\ngranule\n\n\n\n\nHPLC\n\nhigh‐performance liquid chromatography\n\n\n\n\nHPLC‐MS\n\nhigh‐performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nHPLC‐MS/MS\n\nhigh‐performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nHR\n\nhighest residue\n\n\n\n\nIEDI\n\ninternational estimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nIESTI\n\ninternational estimated short‐term intake\n\n\n\n\nILV\n\nindependent laboratory validation\n\n\n\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organisation for Standardization\n\n\n\n\nIUPAC\n\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n\n\n\n\nJMPR\n\nJoint Meeting of the FAO Panel of Experts on Pesticide Residues in Food and the Environment and the WHO Expert Group on Pesticide Residues (Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues)\n\n\n\n\nKoc\n\norganic carbon adsorption coefficient\n\n\n\n\nLOQ\n\nlimit of quantification\n\n\n\n\nMRL\n\nmaximum residue level\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nmass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nMS/MS\n\ntandem mass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nNEU\n\nnorthern European Union\n\n\n\n\nOECD\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development\n\n\n\n\nPBI\n\nplant back interval\n\n\n\n\nPF\n\npeeling factor\n\n\n\n\nPF\n\nprocessing factor\n\n\n\n\nPECsoil\n\npredicted environmental concentration in soil\n\n\n\n\nPHI\n\npreharvest interval\n\n\n\n\nPow\n\npartition coefficient between n‐octanol and water\n\n\n\n\nppm\n\nparts per million (10−6)\n\n\n\n\nPRIMo\n\nEFSA) Pesticide Residues Intake Model\n\n\n\n\nPROFile\n\nEFSA) Pesticide Residues Overview File\n\n\n\n\nQuEChERS\n\nQuick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (analytical method)\n\n\n\n\nRA\n\nrisk assessment\n\n\n\n\nRAC\n\nraw agricultural commodity\n\n\n\n\nRD\n\nresidue definition\n\n\n\n\nRMS\n\nrapporteur Member State\n\n\n\n\nSANCO\n\nDirectorate‐General for Health and Consumers\n\n\n\n\nSC\n\nsuspension concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSEU\n\nsouthern European Union\n\n\n\n\nSMILES\n\nsimplified molecular‐input line‐entry system\n\n\n\n\nSL\n\nsoluble concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSTMR\n\nsupervised trials median residue\n\n\n\n\nTMDI\n\ntheoretical maximum daily intake\n\n\n\n\nTRR\n\ntotal radioactive residue\n\n\n\n\nUV\n\nultraviolet (detector)\n\n\n\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n"

        "summary": "The applicant Syngenta Crop Protection submitted a request to the competent national authority in the Netherlands to evaluate the confirmatory data addressing information that was identified as not available for abamectin in the framework of the maximum residue level ( ) review under Article 12 of Regulation ( ) No 396/2005. In addition, in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation ( ) No 396/2005, the applicant submitted a request to modify the existing  s for abamectin in lamb's lettuces, lettuces, escaroles, cresses and other sprouts/shoots, roman rocket/rucola, baby leaf crops, celery leaves, spinaches and similar leaves, beans with pods and peas with pods. The data gap on the validation for the enforcement analytical method was satisfactorily addressed; in addition, the requested residue trials to support the indoor winter use on lamb's lettuces were provided. For pome fruits and tomatoes, lower  s were derived based on alternative good agricultural practices ( s) already assessed by  . Among the intended new uses requested in the   application, the residue data were sufficient to support an   proposal for the indoor winter use on lamb's lettuces and baby leaf crops, the outdoor Southern Europe use on lamb's lettuces, escaroles, cresses and other sprouts/shoots, roman rocket/rucola, baby leaf crops, spinaches and similar leaves, celery leaves and the indoor winter use on peas with pods. For lettuces and beans with pods, the supporting data were not fully compliant with the data requirements, and further risk management discussions are recommended to decide whether a modification of the existing  s would be appropriate.   updated the most recent consumer risk assessment for abamectin and concluded that the long‐term dietary intake is unlikely to present a risk to consumer health. According to the internationally agreed methodology, an acute consumer risk was not identified in relation to the uses assessed.",
        "full-text": "In 2014, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reviewed the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for abamectin according to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. In its reasoned opinion, EFSA identified some information as unavailable (data gaps) and derived tentative MRLs for those uses which were not fully supported by data but for which no risk to consumers was identified. The following data gaps were noted:\n\nan independent laboratory validation (ILV) and validation of an additional mass transition for the analytical method proposed for enforcement of avermectin B1a, avermectin B1b and delta‐8,9 isomer avermectin B1a, achieving an limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.002 mg/kg for each compound in high acidic, high water content and high oil content matrices;\nadditional residues trials supporting authorisations on almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, pome fruits, cherries, currants, gooseberries, avocados, papaya, tomatoes, lamb's lettuce, lettuce, scarole, leaves and sprouts of Brassica sp., cress, celery leaves, witloof, peas (fresh, without pods), celery, globe artichokes, cotton seed and hops.\na validated analytical method for enforcement of residues in hops (dried);\na storage stability study in hops.\nTentative MRL proposals for abamectin have been implemented in the MRL legislation by Commission Regulation (EU) No 2015/2075, including footnotes related to data gaps number 1 and 2, indicating the type of confirmatory data that should be provided by a party having an interest in maintaining the proposed tentative MRL by 19 November 2017. In a subsequent MRL application for citrus, the data related to the method validation for high acid commodities were provided, and consequently, the footnote was removed from the MRL legislation.Data gap number 2 was translated into footnotes, except for cherries, avocados, cress, peas (fresh, without pods), celery, globe artichokes and cotton seed; for these crops, risk managers decided to lower the MRL at the LOQ without requesting additional residue trials. For hops, risk managers decided to take over the Codex MRLs (CXLs) in the EU MRL legislation; hence, data gaps number 3 and 4 were not implemented.In accordance with the procedure set out in the working document SANTE/10235/2016, Syngenta Crop Protection submitted an application to the competent national authority in the Netherlands, the evaluating Member State (EMS), to evaluate the submitted confirmatory data.The authorised uses assessed during the MRL review for which confirmatory data were requested were not supported any longer by the applicant, except the indoor use on lamb's lettuces. The applicant proposed alternative uses for pome fruits and tomatoes to replace MRLs not confirmed by data.Together with the confirmatory data, the applicant submitted in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, a request to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance abamectin in various crops (lamb's lettuces, lettuces, escaroles, cresses and other sprouts/shoots, roman rocket/rucola, baby leaf crops, celery leaves, spinaches and similar leaves, beans with pods and peas with pods). Altogether, the EMS proposed to confirm the tentative MRL in lettuces and to modify the existing MRLs in lamb's lettuces and baby leaf crops to 3 mg/kg, in pome fruits to 0.02 mg/kg, in tomatoes, escaroles, cresses, roman rucola, spinaches and similar leaves, celery leaves to 0.3 mg/kg, in beans with pods and peas with pods to 0.08 mg/kg. The EMS produced a single evaluation report, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to the EFSA on 25 September 2018.EFSA assessed the application and the evaluation report as required by Article 9 and 10 of the MRL regulation and in accordance with the procedure set out in the working document SANTE/10235/2016. When assessing the evaluation report, EFSA identified points which needed further clarifications. On 4 June 2019, the EMS submitted a revised evaluation report which addressed the points for clarification, and which replaced the previously submitted evaluation report.Based on the conclusions derived by EFSA in the framework of Directive 91/414/EEC and Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 (for amendment of approval conditions), the MRL review, the data evaluated under previous MRL assessments and the additional data provided by the EMS in the framework of the MRL application, the following conclusions are derived.The metabolism of abamectin in primary and rotational crops, and the possible degradation in processed products has been sufficiently addressed and EFSA concluded that the previously derived residue definitions are applicable to the crops assessed in this MRL application.The residue definition for enforcement established in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 for plant products is the ‘sum of avermectin B1a, avermectin B1b, delta‐8,9 isomer of avermectin B1a, expressed as avermectin B1a’. The same residue definition applies for the risk assessment in plants and covers primary crops, rotational crops and processed products.Based on the results of the additional validation data assessed in previous EFSA opinions and submitted in the framework of the MRL confirmatory data application, EFSA concluded that sufficiently validated analytical methods are available to quantify residues of abamectin according to the enforcement residue definition in high water content, high acid content and high oil content matrices. The methods allow quantification of residues at or above 0.002 mg (LOQ) for each individual analyte: The request identified during the MRL review can be considered as satisfactorily addressed.The data gaps for further residue trials compliant with the uses assessed in the framework of the MRL review were not addressed. For pome fruits and tomatoes, the applicant proposed to derive the MRL from an alternative good agricultural practice (GAP) already assessed by EFSA. Among the intended new uses requested in the MRL application, the residue data were sufficient to support MRL proposals for the indoor winter use on lamb's lettuces and baby leaf crops, the outdoor Southern Europe use on lamb's lettuces, escaroles, cresses and other sprouts/shoots, Roman rocket/rucola, baby leaf crops, spinaches and similar leaves, celery leaves and the indoor winter use on peas with pods.Although the data available were not fully compliant with the data requirements, the EMS proposed to discuss with risk managers the possibility to confirm the MRL of 0.09 mg/kg for the indoor summer use in lettuces which was tentatively derived in the framework of the MRL review based on a combined data set of indoor residue trials on lettuces (seven) and lamb's lettuces (two) conducted during the summer period, and likewise, to support the indoor winter use on beans with pods by a combined data set of winter (five) and summer (seven) indoor trials on beans with pods.Specific studies investigating the magnitude of residues of abamectin in processed commodities were not provided and considered as not required during the MRL review. Considering the low chronic dietary exposure of each individual commodity under assessment, this conclusion is confirmed. Significant residue levels are unlikely to occur in rotational crops, provided that the active substance is used according to the proposed GAPs. Investigation of the possible occurrence of abamectin residues in commodities of animal origin is not necessary.The toxicological profile of abamectin was assessed in the framework of the EU pesticides peer review under Directive 91/414/EEC and the data were sufficient to derive toxicological reference values, with an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0.0025 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day and an acute reference dose (ARfD) of 0.005 mg/kg bw.EFSA updated the most recent consumer risk assessment for abamectin performed with revision 2 of the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo). A long‐term consumer risk was not identified for any of the European diets incorporated in the EFSA PRIMo. The highest chronic intake was calculated to be 9.5% of the ADI. According to the internationally agreed methodology, an acute consumer risk was not identified in relation to the uses assessed. However, EFSA noted a relatively narrow safety margin as regards the short‐term exposure to abamectin residues in lamb's lettuces (73% of the ARfD).The process of renewal of the approval of the active substance abamectin in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 is not yet finalised, and therefore, the conclusions reported in this reasoned opinion may need to be reconsidered in the light of the outcome of the peer review.The summary table below provides an overview of the assessment of confirmatory data together with the assessment of the new intended uses and the recommended MRL modifications to Regulation (EU) No 396/2005.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodea\nCommodity\n\nExisting MRLb\n(mg/kg)\n\n\nProposed\nMRL\n(mg/kg)\n\nConclusion/recommendation\n\n\n\n\nEnforcement residue definition: Abamectin (sum of avermectin B1a, avermectin B1b and delta‐8,9 isomer of avermectin B1a, expressed as avermectin B1a) [Link]\n\n\n0120010\nAlmonds\n0.02 ft 1\n\n0.01* or 0.006*\n(further risk management consideration)\n\n\nThe data gap identified in the MRL review related to the analytical method validation has been addressed.

(Footnote related to data gap No 2).\n\n\n\n\n\nAbamectin is the ISO common name for the mixture of avermectin B1a (≥ 80%) and avermectin B1b (≤ 20%). The IUPAC names for the two components of abamectin are:Avermectin B1a:(2aE,4E,8E)‐(5’S,6S,6’R,7S,11R,13S,15S,17aR,20R,20aR,20bS)‐6’‐[(S)‐sec‐butyl] 5’,6,6’,7,10,11,14,15,17a,20,20a,20b‐dodecahydro‐20,20b‐dihydroxy‐5’,6,8,19‐tetramethyl‐17 oxospiro[11,15 methano2H,13H,17H‐furo[4,3,2‐pq][2,6]benzodioxacyclooctadecin‐13,2’‐[2H]pyran]‐7‐yl 2,6‐dideoxy 4‐O(2,6‐dideoxy‐3‐O‐methyl‐α‐L‐arabino‐hexopyranosyl)‐3‐O‐methyl‐α‐L‐arabino‐hexopyranoside.Avermectin B1b:(2aE,4E,8E)‐(5’S,6S,6’R,7S,11R,13S,15S,17aR,20R,20aR,20bS) 5’,6,6’,7,10,11,14,15,17a,20,20a,20bdodecahydro‐20,20b‐dihydroxy‐6’‐isopropyl‐5’,6,8,19 tetramethyl‐17‐oxospiro[11,15‐methano 2H,13H,17H‐furo[4,3,2‐pq][2,6]benzodioxacyclooctadecin 13,2’‐[2H]pyran]‐7‐yl 2,6‐dideoxy‐4‐O(2,6‐dideoxy‐3‐O‐methyl‐α‐L‐arabino‐hexopyranosyl)‐3‐O‐methyl‐α‐L‐arabino‐hexopyranoside.The chemical structures of the active substance main components and metabolites are reported in Appendix E.Abamectin was first evaluated in the framework of Directive 91/414/EEC1 with the Netherlands designated as rapporteur Member State (RMS) for the representative uses as a spray treatment on citrus, lettuces and tomatoes. The draft assessment report (DAR) prepared by the RMS was peer reviewed by EFSA (EFSA, 2008). Following the initial peer review, abamectin was approved2 for the use as insecticide and acaricide on 1 May 2009. The evaluation of the additional representative uses of abamectin as soil drip applications on tomatoes, aubergines, peppers, cucurbits (edible and non‐edible peel) and green beans, were peer reviewed by EFSA (EFSA, 2016). On 3 April 2017, the use was extended to nematicide.3 The process of renewal of the first approval is currently on going.The EU maximum residue levels (MRLs) for abamectin are established in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.4 Following the approval of abamectin, the existing MRLs were assessed according to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 by EFSA (EFSA, 2014) and amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 2015/2075.5 Footnotes were included for certain tentative MRLs for which some information was identified as missing. Any party having an interest in maintaining these MRLs was requested to submit the respective confirmatory data by 19 November 2017.After completion of the MRL review, EFSA has issued several reasoned opinions on the modification of MRLs for abamectin (EFSA, 2015, 2017, 2018). The proposals from these reasoned opinions have been considered in recent regulations for EU MRL legislation.6With respect to the requested confirmatory data, the applicant, Syngenta Crop Protection, submitted information on the validation of a multiresidue analytical enforcement method in high water content, high acid content, high oil content matrices and the results of supervised residue trials to support the indoor use on lamb's lettuces to the competent national authority in the Netherlands (designated rapporteur Member State, RMS) on 10 November 2017. The applicant did not provide further information on residue data to support the authorised uses on almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, pome fruits, currants, gooseberries, papayas, tomatoes, lettuces, escaroles, baby leaf crops, celery leaves and witloof assessed during the MRL review. For tomatoes and pome fruits, the applicant referred to data supporting an alternative good agricultural practice (GAP) that had been assessed previously by EFSA (EFSA, 2008, 2015).Under the same application and in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, Syngenta Crop Protection submitted a request to modify the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for abamectin in lamb's lettuces, lettuces, escaroles, cresses and other sprouts/shoots, Roman rocket/rucola, baby leaf crops, celery leaves, spinaches and similar leaves, beans with pods and peas with pods. The applicant submitted residue data on plums, leeks, cotton and hops. However, since these data were not requested as confirmatory data and they do not trigger a modification of the existing MRLs, they are not assessed in the framework of this reasoned opinion.The EMS drafted a single evaluation report in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 and with the procedure set out in the working document SANTE/10235/2016 (European Commission, 2016). The evaluation report was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to the EFSA on 25 September 2018. EFSA assessed the application and the evaluation report as required by Article 9 and 10 of the MRL regulation and in accordance with the agreed procedure set out in the working document SANTE/10235/2016. During the detailed assessment, EFSA identified points which needed further clarifications. On 4 June 2019, the RMS submitted a revised evaluation report which addressed the points for clarification (Netherlands, 2018).EFSA based its assessment on the evaluation report submitted by the EMS (Netherlands, 2018), the reasoned opinion on the MRL review according to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 (EFSA, 2014) and additional assessments of abamectin performed after the MRL review (EFSA, 2015, 2017, 2018), the DAR and its addendum prepared under Directive 91/414/EEC (Netherlands, 2005, 2008), the European Commission review report on abamectin and its addendum (European Commission, 2008, 2017a), and the conclusions on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance abamectin (EFSA, 2008, 2016).For this application, the data requirements established in Regulation (EU) No 544/20117 and the relevant guidance documents at the date of implementation of the confirmatory data requirements by Regulation (EU) No 2015/2075 and the guidance documents applicable at the date of submission of the application to the RMS are applicable (European Commission, 1997a, b, c, d, e, f g, 2000, 2010a, b, 2017b,; OECD, 2011). The assessment is performed in accordance with the legal provisions of the Uniform Principles for the Evaluation and the Authorisation of Plant Protection Products adopted by Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/2011.8A detailed description of the good agricultural practices (GAPs) for the uses of abamectin based on which tentative MRLs were derived in the framework of the MRL review and the alternative GAPs (Appendix A.1) as well as the new, intended GAPs (Appendix A.2) of abamectin, which are relevant for the current MRL application, are listed in Appendix A.An updated list of end points of the studies assessed by EFSA in the framework of the MRL review, including the end points of relevant studies assessed previously and the confirmatory data evaluated in this application, is presented in Appendix B.The evaluation report submitted by the RMS (Netherlands, 2018) and the exposure calculation using the EFSA pesticides Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) is considered a supporting document to this reasoned opinion and, thus, is made publicly available as a background document to this reasoned opinion.Among the crop under consideration, only the by‐product apple wet pomace is used as feed item. The proposed alternative use on apples is covered by the use assessed during the MRL review and included in the previous calculations11 (EFSA, 2018). Therefore, further investigation on the nature and magnitude of residues in products of animal origin were not necessary.The consumer risk assessment was performed with revision 2 of the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo). This exposure assessment model contains the relevant European food consumption data for different subgroups of the EU population (EFSA, 2007). This exposure assessment model contains food consumption data for different subgroups of the EU population and allows the acute and chronic exposure assessment to be performed in accordance with the internationally agreed methodology for pesticide residues (FAO, 2016).The estimated exposure was then compared with the toxicological reference values derived for abamectin during the EU pesticides peer review (European Commission, 2008). The complete list of input values can be found in Appendix D.1.The data gap identified during the review of the existing MRLs concerning further validation data on the enforcement analytical method was satisfactorily addressed. However, the applicant did not provide further residue data to support the authorised uses on almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, pome fruits, currants, gooseberries, papayas, tomatoes, lamb's lettuces, lettuces, escaroles, baby leaf crops, celery leaves and witloof. For pome fruits and tomatoes, lower MRLs were derived based on alternative GAPs already assessed by EFSA.Among the intended new uses requested in the MRL application, the residue data were sufficient to support an MRL proposal for the indoor winter use on lamb's lettuces and baby leaf crops, the outdoor Southern Europe use on lamb's lettuces, escaroles, cresses and other sprouts/shoots, Roman rocket/rucola, baby leaf crops, spinaches and similar leaves, celery leaves and the indoor winter use on peas with pods. Although the data available to support the indoor summer use on lettuces and the indoor winter use on beans with pods were not fully compliant with the data requirements, the EMS proposed to discuss with risk managers whether a modification of the existing MRLs would be appropriate.Based on the results of the consumer risk assessment, EFSA concluded that the long‐term dietary intake resulting from the authorised and intended uses of abamectin assessed in this reasoned opinion will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the acceptable daily intake (ADI) and therefore is unlikely to pose a chronic risk to consumers’ health. According to the internationally agreed methodology, an acute consumer risk was not identified in relation to the uses assessed. However, EFSA noted a relatively narrow safety margin for lamb's lettuces where the short‐term exposure accounted for 73% of the ARfD.The MRL recommendations are summarised in Appendix B.4.\n\n\n\n\na.s.\n\nactive substance\n\n\n\n\nADI\n\nacceptable daily intake\n\n\n\n\nAR\n\napplied radioactivity\n\n\n\n\nARfD\n\nacute reference dose\n\n\n\n\nBBCH\n\ngrowth stages of mono‐ and dicotyledonous plants\n\n\n\n\nBw\n\nbody weight\n\n\n\n\nCF\n\nconversion factor for enforcement to risk assessment residue definition\n\n\n\n\nCXL\n\nCodex maximum residue limit\n\n\n\n\nDALA\n\ndays after last application\n\n\n\n\nDAR\n\ndraft assessment report\n\n\n\n\nDAT\n\ndays after treatment\n\n\n\n\nDT90\n\nperiod required for 90% dissipation (define method of estimation)\n\n\n\n\nEC\n\nemulsifiable concentrate\n\n\n\n\nEMS\n\nevaluating Member State\n\n\n\n\nEq\n\nresidue expressed as a.s. equivalent\n\n\n\n\nEURL\n\nEU Reference Laboratory (former Community Reference Laboratory (CRL))\n\n\n\n\nFAO\n\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nHPLC\n\nhigh‐performance liquid chromatography\n\n\n\n\nHR\n\nhighest residue\n\n\n\n\nIEDI\n\ninternational estimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nIESTI\n\ninternational estimated short‐term intake\n\n\n\n\nILV\n\nindependent laboratory validation\n\n\n\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organisation for Standardisation\n\n\n\n\nIUPAC\n\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n\n\n\n\nLC\n\nliquid chromatography\n\n\n\n\nLOQ\n\nlimit of quantification\n\n\n\n\nMRL\n\nmaximum residue level\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nMember States\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nmass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nMS/MS\n\ntandem mass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nNEU\n\nnorthern Europe\n\n\n\n\nOECD\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development\n\n\n\n\nPBI\n\nplant back interval\n\n\n\n\nPHI\n\npreharvest interval\n\n\n\n\nPow\n\npartition coefficient between n‐octanol and water\n\n\n\n\nPRIMo\n\n(EFSA) Pesticide Residues Intake Model\n\n\n\n\nQuEChERS\n\nQuick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (analytical method)\n\n\n\n\nRA\n\nrisk assessment\n\n\n\n\nRD\n\nresidue definition\n\n\n\n\nRMS\n\nrapporteur Member State\n\n\n\n\nSANCO\n\nDirectorate‐General for Health and Consumers\n\n\n\n\nSC\n\nsuspension concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSEU\n\nsouthern Europe\n\n\n\n\nSTMR\n\nsupervised trials median residue\n\n\n\n\nTRR\n\ntotal radioactive residue\n\n\n\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n"

        "summary": "According to Article 12 of Regulation ( ) No 396/2005,   has reviewed the maximum residue levels ( s) currently established at European level for the pesticide active substance tefluthrin. To assess the occurrence of tefluthrin residues in plants, processed commodities, rotational crops and livestock,   considered the conclusions derived of Commission Regulation ( ) No 33/2008, as well as the European authorisations reported by Member States (including the supporting residues data). Based on the assessment of the available data,   proposals were derived and a consumer risk assessment was carried out. Some information required by the regulatory framework was missing and a possible acute risk to consumers was identified. Hence, the consumer risk assessment is considered indicative only, some   proposals derived by   still require further consideration by risk managers and measures for reduction of the consumer exposure should also be considered.",

To collect the relevant pesticide residues data, EFSA asked Germany, as the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS), to complete the Pesticide Residues Overview File (PROFile) and to prepare a supporting evaluation report. The PROFile and evaluation report provided by the RMS were made available to the Member States. A request for additional information was addressed to the Member States in the framework of a completeness check period, which was initiated by EFSA on 19 February 2018 and finalised on 19 April 2018. After having considered all the information provided, EFSA prepared a completeness check report which was made available to Member States on 2 July 2018.Based on the conclusions derived by EFSA in the framework of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 and the additional information provided by the RMS and Member States, EFSA prepared in June 2019 a draft reasoned opinion, which was circulated to Member States for consultation via a written procedure. Comments received by 09 August 2019 were considered during the finalisation of this reasoned opinion. The following conclusions are derived.Since tefluthrin is authorised only for soil and seed treatments, to derive the residue definitions EFSA considered the overall data available on primary and rotational crops, including the results from the field trials on primary and rotational crops.The results of the metabolism studies in primary and rotational crops, indicated that following soil treatment (by granules and by soil drench) and seed treatment, the metabolic pathway of tefluthrin was similar in all crop groups investigated. The parent compound is completely degraded to several metabolites. The main compounds were metabolites Ia, IV, VI and XI, generally present at higher percentages and levels in the rotational crop studies than in the primary crop metabolism.Based on the overall data available, EFSA proposes to include metabolites Ia, IV, VI in the residue definition for risk assessment for all primary crops. Since metabolite XI accounted for significant percentages/levels only in the confined rotational crops study, it is proposed to consider metabolite XI relevant for the risk assessment of rotational crops only. The residue definition for enforcement is proposed as parent tefluthrin. The proposed residue definitions are considered applicable to both soil and seed treatment.Apart from the root crops where sufficient data are available to conclude on the residue definitions, for all commodities the proposed residue definitions (for enforcement and risk assessment) are tentative only and might be reconsidered once the missing data (additional toxicological data on metabolites IV and XI; additional trials supporting the current uses and analysing for parent and metabolites; storage stability studies validating the results of the rotational field studies; metabolism studies with short preharvest interval (PHI)) are made available.A validated analytical method is available to enforce the proposed residue definition in all plant commodities at the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.01 mg/kg. Nevertheless, an independent laboratory validation (ILV) is still missing and is required for high oil content and acidic commodities.For what concerns residues in primary crops, the available data are considered sufficient to derive (tentative) MRL proposals as well as risk assessment values for all commodities under evaluation, except for sweet peppers, cucumbers, pumpkins, broccoli, cauliflowers, Brussels sprouts, head cabbages, Chinese cabbages, kales, beans with and without pods, peas with and without pods, leeks and asparagus, where the available data were insufficient to derive a tentative MRL.Specific MRLs for rotational crops are not needed, provided that Member States will take adequate risk mitigation measures (e.g. define plant back interval) or modify the relevant authorisations on sweet corn and maize in order to avoid significant residues to occur in rotational crops.The following conversion factors (CF) from enforcement to risk assessment of primary crops were also derived considering the overall data available: 1 for root crops, 1 for melons and watermelons and tentatively extrapolated to other fruit crops; 2.8 for cereal grain; 32 for cereal straw; 64 for pulses and oilseed; 3.6 for soil treatment of leafy crops; 1 for seed treatment of leafy crops.Tefluthrin is authorised for use on several crops that might be fed to livestock and the dietary burdens calculated for all groups of livestock were found to exceed the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg dry matter (DM). Based on the available metabolism study, the tentative residue definition in ruminants was proposed as tefluthrin for monitoring and as the sum of tefluthrin, metabolites Ia and VI, expressed as tefluthrin for risk assessment. Fully validated analytical methods are available for the enforcement of the proposed residue definition at the LOQ of 0.002 mg/kg for muscle, liver, kidney and fat and at the LOQ of 0.001 mg/kg for milk.Based on the metabolism study and considering the magnitude of residues of tefluthrin and metabolites Ia and VI estimated at the 1 N dose level, residues above the LOQ are expected in all commodities from ruminants and swine, except in cattle and swine kidney, where significant residues are not expected and the MRLs can be set at the LOQ. The following CFs from enforcement to risk assessment were also derived for ruminants and swine: 1 for milk and fat; 1.2 for muscle; 2.3 for liver; 11 for kidney.In the absence of metabolism and feeding studies on hens, it was not possible to derive any MRLs for poultry tissues and eggs.As tefluthrin was initiated under the interim procedure and therefore before 1 February 2018, consumer exposure was calculated with PRIMo model rev. 2. Nonetheless, in order to assist risk managers in the decision‐making process, EFSA has also performed additional calculations using the latest version of the PRIMo model (PRIMo ver. 3.1). For those commodities where data were insufficient to derive an MRL, EFSA considered the existing EU MRL for an indicative calculation.When performing the calculation with PRIMo rev. 2, the highest chronic exposure was calculated for WHO cluster diet B, representing 36% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI). With regard to the acute exposure, however, an exceedance of the acute reference dose (ARfD) was identified for escaroles, representing 252% of the ARfD. A second exposure calculation was therefore performed, excluding this crop. According to the results of this second calculation, the highest chronic exposure remained unchanged; the highest acute exposure is then calculated for carrots, representing 82% of the ARfD.When performing the calculation with PRIMo rev. 3.1, the highest chronic exposure was calculated for GEMS/FoodG10, representing 61% of the ADI. With regard to the acute exposure, however, an exceedance of the ARfD was identified for escaroles and lettuces, representing 116% and 110% of the ARfD, respectively. A second exposure calculation was therefore performed, excluding these crops. According to the results of this second calculation, the highest chronic exposure declined to 60% of the ADI for GEMS/FoodG10; the highest acute exposure is then calculated for carrots, representing 82% of the ARfD.Based on these calculations, a potential risk to consumers was identified for the use of tefluthrin on escaroles (both with PRIMo rev. 2 and 3.1) and lettuces (with PRIMo rev. 3.1 only) and no further refinements of the risk assessment were possible. For the remaining commodities, although major uncertainties remain due to the data gaps identified in the previous sections, the indicative exposure calculation did not indicate a risk to consumers.Regulation (EC) No 396/20051 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Regulation’) establishes the rules governing the setting and the review of pesticide maximum residue levels (MRLs) at European level. Article 12(1) of that Regulation stipulates that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) shall provide within 12 months from the date of the inclusion or non‐inclusion of an active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC2 a reasoned opinion on the review of the existing MRLs for that active substance. As tefluthrin was approved in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/20093 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market, on 1 January 2012 by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 800/20114, and amending the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/20115, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 541/20116, EFSA initiated the review of all existing MRLs for that active substance.According to the legal provisions, EFSA shall base its reasoned opinion in particular on the relevant assessment report prepared under Directive 91/414/EEC. It should be noted, however, that, in the framework of Directive 91/414/EEC, only a few representative uses are evaluated, whereas MRLs set out in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 should accommodate all uses authorised within the European Union (EU), and uses authorised in third countries that have a significant impact on international trade. The information included in the assessment report prepared under Directive 91/414/EEC is therefore insufficient for the assessment of all existing MRLs for a given active substance.To gain an overview of the pesticide residues data that have been considered for the setting of the existing MRLs, EFSA developed the Pesticide Residues Overview File (PROFile). The PROFile is an inventory of all pesticide residues data relevant to the risk assessment and MRL setting for a given active substance. This includes data on:\n\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in primary crops;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in processed commodities;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in rotational crops;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in livestock commodities;\nthe analytical methods for enforcement of the proposed MRLs.\nGermany, the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS) in the framework of Directive 91/414/EEC, was asked to complete the PROFile for tefluthrin and to prepare a supporting evaluation report (Germany, 2014). The PROFile and the supporting evaluation report were submitted to EFSA on 4 July 2014 and made available to the Member States. A request for additional information was addressed to the Member States in the framework of a completeness check period which was initiated by EFSA on 19 February 2018 and finalised on 19 April 2018. Additional evaluation reports were submitted by Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Netherlands and the European Union Reference Laboratories for Pesticide Residues (Czech Republic, 2018; EURL, 2018; France, 2018; Germany, 2018; Greece, 2018; Italy, 2018; Netherlands, 2018; Portugal, 2018; Spain, 2018) and, after having considered all the information provided by RMS and Member States, EFSA prepared a completeness check report which was made available to all Member States on 2 July 2018. Further clarifications were sought from Member States via a written procedure in July 2018.Based on the conclusions derived by EFSA in the framework of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/20087, and the additional information provided by the Member States, EFSA prepared in June 2019 a draft reasoned opinion, which was submitted to Member States for commenting via a written procedure. All comments received by 09 August 2019 were considered by EFSA during the finalisation of the reasoned opinion.The evaluation report submitted by the RMS (Germany, 2014) and the evaluation reports submitted by Member States Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Netherlands and the European Union Reference Laboratories for Pesticide Residues (Czech Republic, 2018; EURL, 2018; France, 2018; Germany, 2018; Greece, 2018; Italy, 2018; Netherlands, 2018; Portugal, 2018; Spain, 2018) are considered as supporting documents to this reasoned opinion and, thus, are made publicly available.In addition, key supporting documents to this reasoned opinion are the completeness check report (EFSA, 2019a) and the Member States consultation report (EFSA, 2019b). These reports are developed to address all issues raised in the course of the review, from the initial completeness check to the reasoned opinion. Also, the chronic and acute exposure calculations for all crops reported in the framework of this review performed using the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) (excel file) and the PROFile are key supporting documents and made publicly available as background documents to this reasoned opinion. Furthermore, screenshots of the Report sheet of the PRIMo rev.2 and rev.3.1 are presented in Appendix C.According to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, EFSA shall provide a reasoned opinion on:\n\nthe inclusion of the active substance in Annex IV to the Regulation, when appropriate;\nthe necessity of setting new MRLs for the active substance or deleting/modifying existing MRLs set out in Annex II or III of the Regulation;\nthe inclusion of the recommended MRLs in Annex II or III to the Regulation;\nthe setting of specific processing factors as referred to in Article 20(2) of the Regulation.\nTefluthrin is a 1:1 mixture of Z‐(1R, 3R) and Z‐(1S, 3S) enantiomers and is the ISO common name for 2,3,5,6‐tetrafluoro‐4‐methylbenzyl (1RS, 3RS)‐3‐[(Z)‐2‐chloro‐3,3,3‐trifluoroprop‐1‐enyl]‐2,2‐dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate (IUPAC).Tefluthrin belongs to the group of pyrethroid compounds which are used as insecticides. The chemical structure of the active substance and its main metabolites are reported in Appendix F.Tefluthrin was evaluated in the framework of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 with Germany designated as RMS. The representative use supported for the peer review process was as a seed treatment against soil‐borne insects in sugar beet. Following the peer review, which was carried out by EFSA, a decision on approval of the active substance in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council was published by means of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 800/2011. According to Regulation (EU) No 540/2011, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 541/2011, tefluthrin is deemed to have been approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. This approval is restricted to uses as insecticide only.The EU MRLs for tefluthrin are established in Annex IIIA of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 and codex maximum residue limits (CXLs) for tefluthrin are not available. An overview of the MRL changes that occurred since the entry into force of the Regulation mentioned above is provided below (Table 1).For the purpose of this MRL review, the critical uses of tefluthrin currently authorised within the EU have been collected by the RMS and reported in the PROFile. The additional good agricultural practices (GAPs) reported by Member States during the completeness check were also considered. The details of the authorised GAPs for tefluthrin are given in Appendix A. The RMS did not report any use authorised in third countries that might have a significant impact on international trade.EFSA has based its assessment on the PROFile submitted by the RMS, the evaluation report accompanying the PROFile (Germany, 2014), the draft assessment report (DAR) and its addenda prepared under Council Directive 91/414/EEC (Germany, 2006, 2009, 2010), the conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance tefluthrin (EFSA, 2010a), the previous reasoned opinions on tefluthrin (France, 2013, 2016; EFSA, 2015, 2017) as well as the evaluation reports submitted during the completeness check (Czech Republic, 2018; EURL, 2018; France, 2018; Germany, 2018; Greece, 2018; Italy, 2018; Netherlands, 2018; Portugal, 2018; Spain, 2018). The assessment is performed in accordance with the legal provisions of the uniform principles for evaluation and authorisation of plant protection products as set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/20118 and the currently applicable guidance documents relevant for the consumer risk assessment of pesticide residues (European Commission, 1997a, b, c, d, e, f–g, 2000, 2010a,b, 2017a; OECD, 2011, 2013).More detailed information on the available data and on the conclusions derived by EFSA can be retrieved from the list of end points reported in Appendix B.Tefluthrin is authorised for use on several crops that might be fed to livestock. Livestock dietary burdens were therefore calculated for different groups of livestock according to OECD guidance (OECD, 2013), which has now also been agreed upon at European level. The input values for all relevant commodities are summarised in Appendix D. The dietary burdens calculated for all groups of livestock were found to exceed the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg dry matter (DM). Behaviour of residues was therefore assessed in all commodities of animal origin.It is highlighted that for several feed items, no sufficient residue data were available (e.g. head cabbage, kale). The animal intake of tefluthrin residues via these commodities has therefore not been assessed and may have been underestimated. However, this is not expected to have a major impact on the outcome of the dietary burden considering the high/overwhelming contribution of soyabeans hulls, and the tentative conservative conversion factors for risk assessment considered in the calculation.It is also noted that a further refinement of the livestock exposure will be possible once the missing residue trials analysing for the metabolites in crops fed to livestock (e.g. cereal straw, pulses and oilseeds) will be made available.As tefluthrin was initiated under the interim procedure and therefore before 1 February 2018, consumer exposure was calculated with PRIMo model rev. 2 (EFSA, 2007) in line with the decision taken at the PAFF meeting held in November 2017 (European Commission, 2017b). Nonetheless, in order to assist risk managers in the decision‐making process, EFSA has also performed additional calculations using the latest version of the PRIMo model (PRIMo ver. 3.1) (EFSA, 2018, 2019c)Input values considered for both calculations were derived in compliance with the decision tree reported in Appendix E. Hence, for those commodities where an (tentative) MRL could be derived by EFSA in the framework of this review, input values were derived according to the internationally agreed methodologies (FAO, 2009). For those commodities where data were insufficient to derive an MRL (sweet peppers, cucumbers, pumpkins, broccoli, cauliflowers, Brussels sprouts, head cabbages, Chinese cabbages, kales, beans with and without pods, peas with and without pods, leeks, asparagus, poultry tissues and eggs), EFSA considered the existing EU MRL for an indicative calculation. Conversion factors were used in the calculations where applicable. All input values included in the exposure calculations are summarised in Appendix D.The exposures calculated were compared with the toxicological reference values for tefluthrin, derived by EFSA (2010a) under Directive 91/414/EEC.When performing the calculation with PRIMo 2, the highest chronic exposure was calculated for WHO cluster diet B, representing 36% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI). With regard to the acute exposure, however, an exceedance of the acute reference dose (ARfD) was identified for escaroles, representing 252% of the ARfD. A second exposure calculation was therefore performed, excluding this crop. According to the results of this second calculation, the highest chronic exposure remained unchanged; the highest acute exposure is then calculated for carrots, representing 82% of the ARfD.When performing the calculation with PRIMo 3.1, the highest chronic exposure was calculated for GEMS/FoodG10, representing 61% of the ADI. With regard to the acute exposure, however, an exceedance of the ARfD was identified for escaroles and lettuces, representing 116% and 110% of the ARfD, respectively. A second exposure calculation was therefore performed, excluding these crops. According to the results of this second calculation, the highest chronic exposure declined to 60% of the ADI for GEMS/FoodG10; the highest acute exposure is then calculated for carrots, representing 82% of the ARfD.Based on these calculations, a potential risk to consumers was identified for the use of tefluthrin on escaroles (both with PRIMo 2 and 3.1) and lettuces (with PRIMo 3.1 only) and no further refinements of the risk assessment were possible. For the remaining commodities, although (major) uncertainties remain due to the data gaps identified in the previous sections, the indicative exposure calculation did not indicate a risk to consumers.EFSA emphasises that the above assessment does not consider the possible impact of plant and livestock metabolism on the isomer ratio of tefluthrin and further investigation on this matter would in principle be required. Since a guidance on the consideration of isomer ratios in the consumer risk assessment has been only recently adopted by EFSA, it is recommended that this issue is reconsidered when such guidance will be taken for note and agreed upon by MSs.Since tefluthrin is authorised only for soil and seed treatments, to derive the residue definitions EFSA considered the overall data available on primary and rotational crops, including the results from the field trials on primary and rotational crops.The results of the metabolism studies in primary and rotational crops indicated that following soil treatment (by granules and by soil drench) and seed treatment, the metabolic pathway of tefluthrin was similar in all crop groups investigated. The parent compound is completely degraded to several metabolites. The main compounds were metabolites Ia, IV, VI and XI, generally present at higher percentages and levels in the rotational crop studies than in the primary crop metabolism.Based on the overall data available, EFSA proposes to include metabolites Ia, IV, VI in the residue definition for risk assessment for all primary crops. Since metabolite XI accounted for significant percentages/levels only in the confined rotational crops study, it is proposed to consider metabolite XI relevant for the risk assessment of rotational crops only. The residue definition for enforcement is proposed as parent tefluthrin. The proposed residue definitions are considered applicable to both soil and seed treatment.Apart from the root crops where sufficient data are available to conclude on the residue definitions, for all commodities the proposed residue definitions (for enforcement and risk assessment) are tentative only and might be reconsidered once the missing data (additional toxicological data on metabolites IV and XI; additional trials supporting the current uses and analysing for parent and metabolites; storage stability studies validating the results of the rotational field studies; metabolism studies with short PHI) are made available.A validated analytical method is available to enforce the proposed residue definition in all plant commodities at the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg. Nevertheless, an ILV is still missing and is required for high oil content and acidic commodities.For what concerns residues in primary crops, the available data are considered sufficient to derive (tentative) MRL proposals as well as risk assessment values for all commodities under evaluation, except for sweet peppers, cucumbers, pumpkins, broccoli, cauliflowers, Brussels sprouts, head cabbages, Chinese cabbages, kales, beans with and without pods, peas with and without pods, leeks and asparagus, where the available data were insufficient to derive a tentative MRL.Specific MRLs for rotational crops are not needed, provided that Member States will take adequate risk mitigation measures (e.g. define plant back interval) or modify the relevant authorisations on sweet corn and maize in order to avoid significant residues to occur in rotational crops.The following conversion factors (CF) from enforcement to risk assessment of primary crops were also derived considering the overall data available: 1 for root crops, 1 for melons and watermelons and tentatively extrapolated to other fruit crops; 2.8 for cereal grain; 32 for cereal straw; 64 for pulses and oilseed; 3.6 for soil treatment of leafy crops; 1 for seed treatment of leafy crops.Tefluthrin is authorised for use on several crops that might be fed to livestock and the dietary burdens calculated for all groups of livestock were found to exceed the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg DM. Based on the available metabolism study, the tentative residue definition in ruminants was proposed as tefluthrin for monitoring and as the sum of tefluthrin, metabolites Ia and VI, expressed as tefluthrin for risk assessment. Fully validated analytical methods are available for the enforcement of the proposed residue definition at the LOQ of 0.002 mg/kg for muscle, liver, kidney and fat and at the LOQ of 0.001 mg/kg for milk.Based on the metabolism study and considering the magnitude of residues of tefluthrin and metabolites Ia and VI estimated at the 1 N dose level, residues above the LOQ are expected in all commodities from ruminants and swine, except in cattle and swine kidney, where significant residues are not expected and the MRLs can be set at the LOQ. The following CFs from enforcement to risk assessment were also derived for ruminants and swine: 1 for milk and fat; 1.2 for muscle; 2.3 for liver; 11 for kidney.In the absence of metabolism and feeding studies on hens, it was not possible to derive any MRLs for poultry tissues and eggs.As tefluthrin was initiated under the interim procedure and therefore before 1 February 2018, consumer exposure was calculated with PRIMo model rev. 2. Nonetheless, in order to assist risk managers in the decision‐making process, EFSA has also performed additional calculations using the latest version of the PRIMo model (PRIMo ver. 3.1). For those commodities where data were insufficient to derive an MRL, EFSA considered the existing EU MRL for an indicative calculation.When performing the calculation with PRIMo rev. 2, the highest chronic exposure was calculated for WHO cluster diet B, representing 36% of the ADI. With regard to the acute exposure, however, an exceedance of the ARfD was identified for escaroles, representing 252% of the ARfD. A second exposure calculation was therefore performed, excluding this crop. According to the results of this second calculation, the highest chronic exposure remained unchanged; the highest acute exposure is then calculated for carrots, representing 82% of the ARfD.When performing the calculation with PRIMo rev. 3.1, the highest chronic exposure was calculated for GEMS/FoodG10, representing 61% of the ADI. With regard to the acute exposure, however, an exceedance of the ARfD was identified for escaroles and lettuces, representing 116% and 110% of the ARfD, respectively. A second exposure calculation was therefore performed, excluding these crops. According to the results of this second calculation, the highest chronic exposure declined to 60% of the ADI for GEMS/FoodG10; the highest acute exposure is then calculated for carrots, representing 82% of the ARfD.Based on these calculations, a potential risk to consumers was identified for the use of tefluthrin on escaroles (both with PRIMo rev. 2 and 3.1) and lettuces (with PRIMo rev. 3.1 only) and no further refinements of the risk assessment were possible. For the remaining commodities, although major uncertainties remain due to the data gaps identified in the previous sections, the indicative exposure calculation did not indicate a risk to consumers.MRL recommendations were derived in compliance with the decision tree reported in Appendix E of the reasoned opinion (see Table 2). All MRL values listed as ‘Recommended’ in the table are sufficiently supported by data and are therefore proposed for inclusion in Annex II to the Regulation. The remaining MRL values listed in the table are not recommended for inclusion in Annex II because they require further consideration by risk managers (see Table 2 footnotes for details). In particular, some tentative MRLs and existing EU MRLs need to be confirmed by the following data:\n\na representative study investigating primary crop metabolism in root crops and leafy crops at short PHIs of 21–30 days (data gap relevant for radishes and asparagus);\nadditional residue trials supporting the authorised uses on sweet peppers, cucumbers, melons, pumpkins, watermelons, broccoli, cauliflowers, Brussels sprouts, head cabbages, Chinese cabbages, kales, beans with and without pods, peas with and without pods, leeks, asparagus, swedes, turnips, celeriacs, tomatoes, aubergines, sweet corn, salad plants, celeries, Florence fennel, rhubarb, sunflower seeds, rapeseeds, soyabeans, cotton seeds, barley, oats, rye, wheat, maize, millet and sorghum;For head cabbages, kale, swedes, turnips, sunflower seeds, soyabeans, rapeseed, cotton seeds, barley, oats, rye, wheat, maize, millet and sorghum, this data gap is also relevant for livestock.It is underlined that the required residue trials should be performed analysing simultaneously for the parent and the metabolites included in the residue definition for risk assessment, by using an analytical method including a hydrolysis step.\nstorage stability studies on the relevant compounds (IV, VI, XI) in high water content, high oil content and dry commodities covering the storage period of 22–26 months;\nstorage stability studies on the relevant compounds tefluthrin and metabolites IV, VI, XI in high acid content commodities (data gap relevant for rhubarbs);\nadditional toxicological data on metabolites IV and XI;\nan ILV for the enforcement of tefluthrin in high oil content and acidic commodities;\na metabolism study on poultry (this data gap might be reconsidered based on the results from the outstanding residue trials on crops fed to livestock).\nIf the above reported data gaps are not addressed in the future, Member States are recommended to withdraw or modify the relevant authorisations at national level.Furthermore, it is highlighted that a possible risk to consumers was identified for the most critical GAPs that are currently authorised for escarole (with both PRIMo rev.2 and rev. 3.1) and lettuces (with PRIMo rev.3.1. only). Member States are therefore recommended to withdraw their national authorisations for these crops where no fall‐back MRL could be derived by EFSA.In this review, EFSA also identified the following data gap which is not expected to impact on the validity of the MRLs derived but which might have an impact on national authorisations:\n\nfield rotational crop studies covering the most critical GAP currently authorised on sweet corn and maize and the calculated plateau in soil.\nPending the submission of these studies, Member States granting authorisations for tefluthrin should take the appropriate risk mitigation measures (e.g. define plant back interval) or modify the relevant authorisations on sweet corn and maize in order to avoid the presence of significant residues in rotational crops.EFSA emphasises that the above assessment does not consider the possible impact of plant and livestock metabolism on the isomer ratio of tefluthrin and further investigation on this matter would in principle be required. Since a guidance on the consideration of isomer ratios in the consumer risk assessment has been only recently adopted by EFSA, it is recommended that this issue is reconsidered when such guidance will be taken for note and agreed upon by MSs.\n\n\n\n\na.i.\n\nactive ingredient\n\n\n\n\na.s.\n\nactive substance\n\n\n\n\nADI\n\nacceptable daily intake\n\n\n\n\nARfD\n\nacute reference dose\n\n\n\n\nBBCH\n\ngrowth stages of mono‐ and dicotyledonous plants\n\n\n\n\nbw\n\nbody weight\n\n\n\n\nCF\n\nconversion factor for enforcement residue definition to risk assessment residue definition\n\n\n\n\nCS\n\ncapsule suspension\n\n\n\n\nCV\n\ncoefficient of variation (relative standard deviation)\n\n\n\n\nCXL\n\ncodex maximum residue limit\n\n\n\n\nDAR\n\ndraft assessment report\n\n\n\n\nDAT\n\ndays after treatment\n\n\n\n\nDM\n\ndry matter\n\n\n\n\nDT90\n\nperiod required for 90% dissipation (define method of estimation)\n\n\n\n\nEC\n\nemulsifiable concentrate\n\n\n\n\neq\n\nresidue expressed as a.s. equivalent\n\n\n\n\nEURLs\n\nEuropean Union Reference Laboratories for Pesticide Residues (former CRLs)\n\n\n\n\nFAO\n\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nGC\n\nGas chromatography\n\n\n\n\nGC‐MS\n\ngas chromatography with mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nGR\n\ngranule\n\n\n\n\nHPLC‐MS/MS\n\nhigh‐performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nHR\n\nhighest residue\n\n\n\n\nIEDI\n\ninternational estimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nIESTI\n\ninternational estimated short‐term intake\n\n\n\n\nILV\n\nindependent laboratory validation\n\n\n\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organisation for Standardization\n\n\n\n\nIUPAC\n\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n\n\n\n\nKoc\n\norganic carbon adsorption coefficient\n\n\n\n\nLC\n\nliquid chromatography\n\n\n\n\nLC–MS/MS\n\nliquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nLOQ\n\nlimit of quantification\n\n\n\n\nMo\n\nmonitoring\n\n\n\n\nMRL\n\nmaximum residue level\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nMember States\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nmass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nMS/MS\n\ntandem mass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nNEU\n\nnorthern European Union\n\n\n\n\nOECD\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development\n\n\n\n\nPAFF\n\nStanding Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed\n\n\n\n\nPBI\n\nplant back interval\n\n\n\n\nPF\n\nprocessing factor\n\n\n\n\nPHI\n\npreharvest interval\n\n\n\n\nPow\n\npartition coefficient between n‐octanol and water\n\n\n\n\nppm\n\nparts per million (10−6)\n\n\n\n\nPRIMo\n\n(EFSA) Pesticide Residues Intake Model\n\n\n\n\nPROFile\n\n(EFSA) Pesticide Residues Overview File\n\n\n\n\nQuEChERS\n\nQuick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (analytical method)\n\n\n\n\nRA\n\nrisk assessment\n\n\n\n\nRD\n\nresidue definition\n\n\n\n\nRD\n\nresidue definition\n\n\n\n\nRMS\n\nrapporteur Member State\n\n\n\n\nSANCO\n\nDirectorate‐General for Health and Consumers\n\n\n\n\nSC\n\nsuspension concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSEU\n\nsouthern European Union\n\n\n\n\nSMILES\n\nsimplified molecular‐input line‐entry system\n\n\n\n\nSTMR\n\nsupervised trials median residue\n\n\n\n\nTRR\n\ntotal radioactive residue\n\n\n\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n"

        "full-text": "The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) asked the Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) to deliver a Scientific Opinion on the maintenance of the list of qualified presumption of safety (QPS) biological agents intentionally added to food or feed. The request included three specific tasks as mentioned in the Terms of Reference (ToR).The QPS process was developed to provide a harmonised generic pre‐evaluation procedure to support safety risk assessments of biological agents performed by EFSA's scientific Panels and Units. The taxonomic identity, body of knowledge and safety of biological agents are assessed. Safety concerns identified for a taxonomic unit (TU) are, where possible to be confirmed at strain or product level, reflected as ‘qualifications’ that should be assessed at the strain level by the EFSA's scientific Panels. A generic qualification for all QPS bacterial TUs applies in relation to the absence of acquired genes conferring resistance to clinically relevant antimicrobials (EFSA, 2008).The list of microorganisms is maintained and re‐evaluated approximately every 6 months in a Panel Statement. If new information is retrieved from extended literature searches that would change the QPS status of a microbial species or its qualifications, this is published in the Panel Statement. The Panel Statement also includes the evaluation of microbiological agents newly notified to EFSA within the 6‐month period. The main results of the assessments completed from 2017 onwards were included in the scientific Opinion of the BIOHAZ Panel adopted in December 2019. Until July 2019, as a result of each Panel Statement, the ‘2016 updated list of QPS status recommended biological agents for safety risk assessments carried out by EFSA scientific Panels and Units’ was extended by the inclusion of new recommendations for QPS status and appended to the Opinion adopted in December 2016 (Appendix E). The results of the current Panel Statement have been included in the ‘2019 updated list of QPS status recommended biological agents for safety risk assessments carried out by EFSA scientific Panels and Units’.The first ToR requires ongoing updates of the list of biological agents notified to EFSA, in the context of a technical dossier for safety assessment. The overall list (https://doi.org/record/zenodo.3607184) was updated with the notifications received since the latest review in March 2019. Within this period, 54 notifications were received by EFSA, of which 27 were for feed additives, 15 for food enzymes, food additives and flavourings, 9 for novel foods and 3 for plant protection products (PPPs). The new notifications received between April 2019 and September 2019 are also included in the current Statement (see Appendix F).The second ToR concerns the revision of the TUs previously recommended for the QPS list and their qualifications when new information has become available, and the updating of the information provided in the previous Opinion adopted in December 2016. According to the articles retrieved through an extensive literature search (ELS) protocol available in Appendix B (see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3607190 and the search strategies in Appendix C (see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3607193, for articles published from January until June 2019, no new information was found that would affect the QPS status of those TUs and their qualifications.The third ToR requires a (re)assessment of new TUs notified to EFSA, for their suitability for inclusion in the updated QPS list at the Knowledge Junction in Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1146566, Appendix E). The current Statement focuses on the assessments of the TUs that were notified to EFSA between April and September 2019. Of the 54 notifications received, 23 biological agents already had QPS status and did not require further evaluation in this Statement and 14 were not included because: 7 were notifications of filamentous fungi that were excluded from the QPS exercise; 6 were notifications of Escherichia coli that were excluded from further QPS evaluations within the current QPS mandate and Sphingomonas paucimobilis which was already evaluated in the previous Panel Statement. Seventeen new notifications, corresponding to 16 TUs, were considered for the QPS assessment within this Statement:Eight TUs have been recommended for the QPS status. Protaminobacter rubrum, was evaluated during the previous QPS mandate and still cannot be assessed for a possible QPS recommendation because it is not a valid species name. Lactobacillus parafarraginis and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii are recommended to be included in the QPS list. Parageobacillus thermoglucosidasius and Paenibacillus illinoisensis can be recommended for the QPS list with the qualification ‘for production purposes only’ and absence of toxigenic potential. Bacillus velezensis can be recommended for the QPS list with the qualification ‘absence of toxigenic potential and the absence of aminoglycoside production ability’. Cupriavidus necator, Aurantiochytrium limacinum and Tetraselmis chuii can be recommended for the QPS list with the qualification ‘for production purposes only’. Pantoea ananatis is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge in relation to its pathogenicity potential for plants. Corynebacterium stationis, Hamamotoa singularis, Rhodococcus aetherivorans and Rhodococcus ruber cannot be recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge. Kodamaea ohmeri cannot be recommended for the QPS list due to safety concerns.The qualified presumption of safety (QPS) approach was developed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Scientific Committee to provide a generic concept for risk assessment within the EFSA of microorganisms intentionally introduced into the food chain, in support of the respective Scientific Panels and Units in the frame of market authorisations (EFSA, 2007a,b). The list, first established in 2007, has been continuously revised and updated. Each 6 months, a Panel Statement is published. These Panel Statements include the results of the assessment of the relevant new papers related to the TUs with QPS status. They also contain the assessment of newly arrived TUs to the EFSA Units (dealing with feed additives, food enzymes, food additives and flavourings, novel foods or plant protection products. After 3 years, a QPS opinion is published summarising the results of the Panel Statements published in that period.ToR 1: Keep updated the list of biological agents being notified, in the context of a technical dossier to EFSA Units (such as Feed, Food Ingredients and Packaging (FIP), Nutrition Unit and Pesticides Unit), for intentional use in feed and/or food or as sources of food and feed additives, enzymes and plant protection products for safety assessment:Between April 2019 and September 2019, the list was updated with 54 notifications that were received by EFSA, of which 25 were for feed additives, 15 for food enzymes, food additives and flavourings, 9 for novel foods and 3 for plant protection products.ToR 2: Review taxonomic units previously recommended for the QPS list and their qualifications when new information has become available:In relation to the results of the monitoring of possible new safety concerns related to the QPS list, there were no results that justify removal of any TU from the QPS list or changes in their respective qualifications.ToR 3: (Re)assess the suitability of taxonomic units notified to EFSA not present in the current QPS list for their inclusion in that list:The TUs corresponding to 23 out of the 54 notifications received, already had a QPS status.Of the 31 notifications without a QPS status, 7 notifications related to filamentous fungi which were excluded from QPS activities in the follow‐up of a recommendation of the QPS 2013 update (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2013, 2014, 2016), 6 notifications related to E. coli, which was excluded from the current mandate by the BIOHAZ Panel (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2018a) Sphingomonas paucimobilis which was already evaluated in the previous Panel Statement.\n\nThe remaining 17 notifications, corresponding to 16 TUs were evaluated:\nProtaminobacter rubrum already evaluated during the previous QPS mandate\nSchizochytrium sp. which it is a genus and not a species and therefore, not adequate for QPS approach.\nAurantiochytrium limacinum, Bacillus velezensis, Corynebacterium stationis, Cupriavidus necator, Hamamotoa singularis, Kodamaea ohmeri, Lactobacillus parafarraginis, Paenibacillus

        "summary": "Following a request from the European Commission, the   Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed ( ) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of lignosulphonate, when used as a technological additive, functional group: binders. In a previous opinion, the   Panel could not conclude on the safety of the additive for target species and for the environment. The applicant provided additional information that was assessed in the current opinion. As regards the safety for the target species, the maximum recommended content of lignosulphonate of 10,000 mg/kg complete feed is considered safe in weaned piglet. A safe concentration of lignosulphonate in feed for salmonids and dairy cows could not be identified. The   Panel reiterates also its previous conclusions that ‘10,000 mg lignosulphonate/kg complete feed is safe for chickens for fattening, laying hens and cattle for fattening but a margin of safety cannot be identified. Therefore, this conclusion cannot be extended to all animal species/categories’. Considering the absence of adverse effects confirmed by all the ecotoxicity studies up to very high concentrations, no concerns for the environment are expected from the use of this additive in animal nutrition according the conditions of use. Lignosulphonate is efficacious as pellet binder.",
        "full-text": "The present opinion deals with the re‐evaluation of the use of lignosulphonate as a technological additive, functional group: binders, in feedingstuffs for all animal species.Lignosulphonates are amorphous branched polymers of lignin, containing sulphonated covalently linked phenyl propane monomers (C9). The polymers have an average molecular weight ranging from 1,000 to 250,000 Da. Depending on the type of pulping process, different salts, including calcium lignosulphonate, sodium lignosulphonate and magnesium lignosulphonate, can be obtained. Since the cations are not considered relevant for the efficacy of the additive as a pellet binder and the nutrition of target animals, lignosulphonates are treated in the assessment of the FEEDAP Panel as a single additive.In its previous opinion, the FEEDAP Panel concluded on the safety of the additive for consumers, for users/workers; concerning efficacy, the Panel concluded that the additive is efficacious as pellet binder at the minimum concentration of 7,500 mg/kg complete feed – this level was not the one proposed by the applicant of 1,000 mg/kg complete feed (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 2015). The data provided, however, did not allow the Panel to conclude on the safety of the additive for the target species and the environment. In the same opinion, the Panel proposed updated specifications regarding the content of lignosulphonate and reducing sugars in the additive.The applicant submitted additional information to support new specifications, the safety of the additive for the target species and the environment and the efficacy at concentrations lower than 7,500 mg/kg complete feed.The maximum recommended content of lignosulphonate of 10,000 mg/kg complete feed is considered safe in weaned piglets, based on the results of the tolerance study assessed; this conclusion confirms the former one for pigs for fattening. A safe concentration of lignosulphonate in feed for salmonids and dairy cows could not be identified. Considering the previous opinion and the new information provided in the current submission, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that supplementation of diets with lignosulphonate at 10,000 mg/kg complete feed is safe for weaned piglets, pigs for fattening, chickens for fattening, laying hens and cattle for fattening. Since a margin of safety cannot be identified, the Panel cannot conclude on the safety of lignosulphonate for the other target species/categories.No concerns for the environment are expected from the use of the additive under assessment in animal nutrition according to the conditions of use.Lignosulphonate is efficacious as pellet binder in a dose‐dependent manner, effects were seen in range of 2,500–7,500 mg/kg complete feed.The FEEDAP Panel recommends that the specifications for the additive should contain lignosulphonate ≥ 55% and reducing sugars ≤ 20%.Since the effect of lignosulphonate as a pellet binder depends on feed composition and on the feed processing conditions applied, the FEEDAP Panel recommends not to establish a minimum effective concentration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nEvent\n\n\n\n\n01/03/2017\nDossier received by EFSA.

        "summary": "The conclusions of the European Food Safety Authority ( ) following the peer review of the initial risk assessments carried out by the competent authorities of the rapporteur Member State Austria and co‐rapporteur Member State Lithuania for the pesticide active substance blood meal and the considerations as regards the inclusion of the substance in Annex   of Regulation ( ) No 396/2005 are reported. The context of the peer review was that required by Commission Implementing Regulation ( ) No 844/2012, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation ( ) No 2018/1659. The conclusions were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of blood meal as a game repellent on deciduous and coniferous trees in forestry, orchard trees and ornamental plants and as a vole repellent on deciduous and coniferous trees in forestry (field uses). The reliable end points, appropriate for use in regulatory risk assessment are presented. Missing information identified as being required by the regulatory framework is listed. No concerns are identified.",
        "full-text": "Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/1659, lays down the procedure for the renewal of the approval of active substances submitted under Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. The list of those substances is established in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 686/2012 as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2016/183. Blood meal is one of the active substances listed in that Regulation.In accordance with Article 1 of Regulation (EU) No 844/2012, the rapporteur Member State (RMS), Austria, and co‐rapporteur Member State (co‐RMS), Lithuania, received an application from Plantskydd AB for the renewal of approval of the active substance blood meal. In addition, the applicant submitted an application for inclusion of the substance in Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.An initial evaluation of the dossier on blood meal was provided by the RMS in the renewal assessment report (RAR) and subsequently, a peer review of the pesticide risk assessment on the RMS evaluation was conducted by EFSA in accordance with Article 13 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/1659. The following conclusions are derived.The uses of blood meal according to the representative uses as a game repellent on deciduous and coniferous trees in forestry, orchard trees and ornamental plants, as proposed at European Union (EU) level, result in a sufficient repellent efficacy against the target games. The proposed uses as a vole repellent were not supported by efficacy data.The assessment of the data package revealed no issues that could not be finalised or that need to be included as critical areas of concern with respect to identity, physical and chemical properties and analytical methods.No data gaps or critical areas of concern were identified in the mammalian toxicology section.Considering the uses of blood meal according to the representative uses as a game repellent on orchard trees, the consumer dietary risk to blood meal residues is considered as very unlikely. Blood meal meets the criteria for inclusion in Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.The fate and behaviour in the environment of blood meal residues are expected to follow the normal pathways of dissipation and degradation common to naturally occurring residues of biological origin. Considering the nature of the substance and most methods of application leading to negligible levels of environmental exposure, further consideration of its fate and behaviour in the environment was concluded to be unnecessary, with the exception of when application is made by less targeted spray application methods such as tractor‐mounted hydraulic sprayers or air‐assisted broadcast spraying. In this situation, further information would be needed to refine the environmental exposure assessment to aquatic systems.In the area of ecotoxicology, the available data for aquatic organisms were not sufficient to demonstrate a low risk from the uses with less targeted spray application methods such as tractor‐mounted hydraulic sprayers or air‐assisted broadcast spraying. No critical areas of concern were identified.Blood meal does not meet the criteria for endocrine disruption for humans and non‐target organisms as set out in points 3.6.5 and 3.8.2 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) 2018/605.Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/20121, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/16592 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Regulation’), lays down the provisions for the procedure of the renewal of the approval of active substances, submitted under Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/20093. This regulates for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) the procedure for organising the consultation of Member States, the applicant(s) and the public on the initial evaluation provided by the rapporteur Member State (RMS) and/or co‐rapporteur Member State (co‐RMS) in the renewal assessment report (RAR), and the organisation of an expert consultation where appropriate.In accordance with Article 13 of the Regulation, unless formally informed by the European Commission that a conclusion is not necessary, EFSA is required to adopt a conclusion on whether the active substance can be expected to meet the approval criteria provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 within 5 months from the end of the period provided for the submission of written comments, subject to an extension of an additional 3 months where additional information is required to be submitted by the applicant(s) in accordance with Article 13(3). In accordance with Article 13(3a), where the information available in the dossier is not sufficient to conclude the assessment on whether the approval criteria for endocrine disruption are met, additional information can be requested to be submitted in a period of minimum 3 months, depending on the type of information requested.In accordance with Article 1 of the Regulation, the RMS, Austria, and co‐RMS, Lithuania, received an application from Plantskydd AB for the renewal of approval of the active substance blood meal. In addition, the applicant submitted an application for inclusion of the substance into Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/20054. Complying with Article 8 of the Regulation, the RMS checked the completeness of the dossier and informed the applicant, the co‐RMS (Lithuania), the European Commission and EFSA about the admissibility.The RMS provided its initial evaluation of the dossier on blood meal in the RAR, which was received by EFSA on 18 February 2019 (Austria, 2019a). The RAR included a proposal to include the substance into Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. Furthermore, this conclusion also addresses the assessment required from EFSA under Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. On 19 August 2019, EFSA invited the Member States to submit their Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) that are authorised nationally, in the format of specific GAP forms. All the GAPs were collected by EFSA and they are made publicly available as a background document to this conclusion, in the format of a specific GAP overview file.In accordance with Article 12 of the Regulation, EFSA distributed the RAR to the Member States and the applicant, Plantskydd AB, for consultation and comments on 25 March 2019. EFSA also provided comments. In addition, EFSA conducted a public consultation on the RAR. EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the European Commission on 28 May 2019. At the same time, the collated comments were forwarded to the RMS for compilation and evaluation in the format of reporting table. In addition, the applicant was invited to respond to the comments received. The comments and the applicant's response were evaluated by the RMS in column 3.The need for expert consultation and the necessity for additional information to be submitted by the applicant in accordance with Article 13(3) of the Regulation were considered in a telephone conference between EFSA and the RMS on 5 July 2019. On the basis of the comments received, the applicant's response to the comments and the RMS's evaluation thereof, it was concluded that additional information should be requested from the applicant, and that there was no need to conduct an expert consultation.The outcome of the telephone conference, together with EFSA's further consideration of the comments, is reflected in the conclusions set out in column 4 of the reporting table. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase and which required further consideration were compiled by EFSA in the format of an evaluation table.The conclusions arising from the consideration by EFSA, and as appropriate by the RMS, of the points identified in the evaluation table, together with the outcome of the written consultation on the assessment of additional information, were reported in the final column of the evaluation table.A final consultation on the conclusions arising from the peer review of the risk assessment and on the Article 12 maximum residue level (MRL) review of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, took place with Member States via a written procedure in December 2019–January 2020.This conclusion report summarises the outcome of the peer review of the risk assessment of the active substance and the representative formulation, evaluated on the basis of the representative uses of blood meal as a game repellent on deciduous and coniferous trees in forestry, orchard trees and ornamental plants, and as a vole repellent on deciduous and coniferous trees in forestry (field uses), as proposed by the applicant. In accordance with Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, risk mitigation options identified in the RAR and considered during the peer review, if any, are presented in the conclusion. A list of the relevant end points for the active substance and the formulation is provided in Appendix A.A key supporting document to this conclusion is the peer review report (EFSA, 2020), which is a compilation of the documentation developed to evaluate and address all issues raised in the peer review, from the initial commenting phase to the conclusion. The peer review report comprises the following documents, in which all views expressed during the course of the peer review, including minority views, where applicable, can be found:\n\n\nthe comments received on the RAR;\n\nthe reporting table (5 July 2019);\n\nthe evaluation tables (16 December 2019);\n\nthe comments received on the assessment of the additional information (where relevant);\n\nthe comments received on the draft EFSA conclusion.\n\nGiven the importance of the RAR, including its revisions (Austria, 2019b), and the peer review report, both documents are considered as background documents to this conclusion and thus are made publicly available.It is recommended that this conclusion report and its background documents would not be accepted to support any registration outside the EU for which the applicant has not demonstrated that it has regulatory access to the information on which this conclusion report is based.The active substance blood meal is formed from dried red cells of porcine blood of food grade quality, collected in authorised slaughterhouses, heat treated to destroy microorganism contamination. This substance is considered by the International Organization for Standardization not to require a common name.The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ‘Certosan’, a wettable powder (WP) containing 998 g/kg blood meal.The representative uses evaluated are as a game repellent on deciduous and coniferous trees in forestry, orchard trees and ornamental plants by coating with brush, spraying or dipping individual plants, entire plants, and as a vole repellent on deciduous and coniferous trees in forestry (field uses), by application on the plants via brush, spray or dipping of individual plants at plantation. Full details of the representative uses can be found in the list of end points in Appendix A.The uses of blood meal according to the representative uses as a game repellent on deciduous and coniferous trees in forestry, orchard trees and ornamental plants, as proposed at EU level, result in a sufficient repellent efficacy against the target games. It should be noted that the use as a vole repellent was not supported by efficacy data.The following guidance documents were followed in the production of this conclusion: European Commission, 2000, 2010.The active substance is 100% blood meal with a minimum haemoglobin content of 80%. The blood conforms with the specific requirements for processed animal protein set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/20115 and with the public health and animal health rules for animal by‐products and derived products not intended for human consumption laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1069/20096. Regulation (EC) No 853/20047 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin and Council Directive 97/78/EC8 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries also apply. It is proposed to update the reference specification from the first approval with the correct expression of the minimum haemoglobin content.The batch data and the analytical method proposed for quantification of the active substance in the plant protection product are based on the determination of the iron content, considering the relationship between the iron content and the corresponding haemoglobin content.9 Internationally agreed methods are used for the control of the human pathogenic germs content of the formulation.The main data regarding the identity of blood meal and its physical and chemical properties are given in Appendix A.It should be noted that swirling is necessary to wet the product, requiring proper label instructions.As residue definition is proposed only for water, the need for methods of analysis for monitoring can be waived, with the exception of a method for water. An inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP‐OES) method exists for the determination of the residues in water expressed as iron content with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1.0 μg/L. The reference method for measuring haemoglobin by the International Committee for Standardization in Haematology (ICSH) is the haemoglobincyanide (HiCN) test.Blood meal does not have a toxic mode of action and does not in itself present a toxicological concern. Since the manufacturing process ensures a food grade quality of the active substance, all toxicological data requirements are waived. Furthermore, blood is a major constituent of the human body and in general of all vertebrates, and it may be present in food items such as meat consumed as part of normal diet. Toxicological reference values are not required and a quantitative risk assessment for operators, workers and bystanders is not considered necessary. This conclusion is in line with the one reached during the previous peer review (EFSA, 2011).For the representative uses on forestry and ornamental plants, no exposure of food and feed items is expected, and a consumer dietary risk assessment is therefore not required for these uses.For the representative use in orchards consisting of coating with brush, spraying or dipping the plants, residues of blood meal may be present on the fruits and a consumer exposure to blood meal residues cannot be excluded. The use in orchards strictly requires the use of blood meal of food grade quality in accordance with the current EU legislation for animal by‐products.Based on this consideration, toxicological reference values are not required for blood meal and a consumer dietary risk to blood meal residues is considered as very unlikely. Therefore, blood meal meets the criteria for inclusion in Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.Based on these considerations, the data requirement to determine the residues of blood meal in pollen and bee products can be considered as addressed.As regards to the submitted European authorised uses in different crop groups, some of these uses were characterised by two instead of one foliar spray application and were therefore not covered by the representative use in orchards. However, provided that blood meal is of food grade quality, the criteria for the inclusion of this active substance in the Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 are met and MRLs are not required for the authorised uses.No studies to investigate the fate and behaviour in the environmental compartments of blood meal were submitted as blood meal residues are expected to follow the normal pathways of dissipation and degradation common to naturally occurring residues of biological origin. The degradation of organic N‐combinations starts with mineralisation followed by nitrification. The application rate (ca. 20 kg/ha) is not expected to produce exposures to the terrestrial environment to this kind of material at levels above those that may occur by natural causes (e.g. arising from the death of mammals). The influence of an application of blood meal of ca. 20 kg/ha compared to the natural N‐content in soils in 0–20 cm depth is considered to be negligible. Therefore, further data or considerations of the fate and behaviour in the environment of this active substance in soil are deemed to be unnecessary for the representative uses with application by coating with brush and spraying or dipping individual plants. However, in the situation where less targeted spray methods of application are employed (such as, e.g. tractor‐mounted hydraulic sprayers or air‐assisted broadcast spraying), that do not preclude surface water exposure, an aquatic exposure assessment is needed.10 Predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) in surface water and sediment were carried out using the FOCUS (2001) step 1 and step 2 approach (version 3.2 of the Steps 1–2 in FOCUS calculator) considering worst‐case assumptions (i.e. no degradation in both the soil and water/sediment compartments, no crop interception). Based on the available aquatic risk assessment (refer to Section 5), information on the degradation of the active substance in water/sediment is needed to refine the assessment for the representative uses with spray application on the entire plant when less targeted spraying techniques such as tractor‐mounted hydraulic sprayers or air‐assisted broadcast spraying are employed (data gap). For the more direct application methods to the plants/trees (by brush, hand‐held spraying directed to the tree base or trunk or dipping of individual plants at planting), the potential for the exposure of aquatic systems can be considered negligible.The applicant did not provide appropriate information to address the effect of water treatment processes on the nature of the residues that might be present in surface water, when surface water is abstracted for drinking water. However, based on the conclusion in Section 3 that a consumer dietary risk to blood meal residues is considered as very unlikely, this lack of information is considered not an issue of concern and no further data need to be provided.The risk assessment was based on the following documents: European Commission (2002), EFSA PPR Panel (2013) and ECHA/EFSA (2018).The risk to birds and wild mammals was assessed considering that (i) the active substance is a game/vole repellent without any toxic mode of action (see Section 2), and (ii) it is a part of human diet and there are no indications that it is of human or animal concern (see Section 3). On this basis, a low risk to birds and wild mammals was concluded.For aquatic organisms, standard toxicity data with the representative formulation were available with fish, aquatic invertebrates (daphnia) and algae. A quantitative tier 1 risk assessment for aquatic organisms indicated low risk for algae at FOCUS Step 2 but not for fish and aquatic invertebrates. Therefore, the risk to fish and aquatic invertebrates would need to be further addressed for the representative uses with spray application on the entire plant when less targeted spraying techniques such as, e.g. tractor‐mounted hydraulic sprayers or air‐assisted broadcast spraying are employed (data gap). For the more direct application methods to the plants/trees (i.e. by brush, hand‐held spraying directed to the tree base or trunk or dipping of individual plants at planting), negligible environmental exposure is expected (see Section 4), and consequently, the risk to aquatic organisms from these uses is considered to be low.Acute toxicity data were available for honey bees with the representative formulation indicating that the substance is not acutely toxic to bees. On the basis of the available information and considering the representative uses, a low risk to bees, via contact and oral exposure, was concluded.The risk to honey bees via consumption of contaminated water was assessed as low.No toxicity data were available for bumblebees or solitary bees.In accordance with European Commission (2002), two toxicity tests were available with the representative formulation and the non‐target arthropod species Pardosa ssp. and Poecilus cupreus indicating no adverse effects at application rates equal to the maximum application rate of the representative uses. Thus, the risk to non‐target arthropods was considered to be low.No toxicity data with blood meal and earthworms and other soil macroorganisms, soil microorganisms and non‐target terrestrial plants or quantitative risk assessments were submitted nor required due to the expected negligible environmental exposure in soil (see Section 4).No exposure for sewage treatment plants would be expected for all representative uses; therefore, no data were necessary.With regard to the assessment of the endocrine disruption potential of blood meal for humans and non‐target organisms according to the ECHA/EFSA guidance (2018), although no (eco)toxicological data are available to assess the endocrine‐disrupting properties, this does not appear scientifically necessary since the manufacturing process ensures a food grade quality of the active substance; red blood cells only are used in the final product while plasma fraction is disregarded; blood is a major constituent of the human body and in general of all vertebrates, and it may be present in food items such as meat consumed as part of normal diet or provided as part of the basal diet when breeding fish. Furthermore, blood meal has a non‐toxic mode of action and is non‐toxic by itself. Therefore, it is justified to waive the assessment of endocrine‐disrupting properties of this substance for both humans and non‐target organisms.Considering the above, it can be concluded that blood meal does not meet the criteria for endocrine disruption for humans and non‐target organisms according to points 3.6.5 and 3.8.2 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) 2018/60511.This is a list of data gaps identified during the peer review process, including those areas in which a study may have been made available during the peer review process but not considered for procedural reasons (without prejudice to the provisions of Article 56 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 concerning information on potentially harmful effects).\n\n\nInformation to refine the risk to fish and aquatic invertebrates when less targeted spraying techniques such as tractor‐mounted hydraulic sprayers or air‐assisted broadcast spraying are employed was not available (relevant for the representative uses employing these application techniques; see Sections 4 and 5).\n\nNo particular conditions are proposed for the representative uses evaluated.\n\n\n\n\nADI\n\nacceptable daily intake\n\n\n\n\nECHA\n\nEuropean Chemicals Agency\n\n\n\n\nEEC\n\nEuropean Economic Community\n\n\n\n\nFOCUS\n\nForum for the Co‐ordination of Pesticide Fate Models and their Use\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nICP‐OES\n\ninductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy\n\n\n\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organization for Standardization\n\n\n\n\nLOQ\n\nlimit of quantification\n\n\n\n\nmm\n\nmillimetre (also used for mean measured concentrations)\n\n\n\nMRL\nmaximum residue level \n\n\n\nPD\n\nproportion of different food types\n\n\n\n\nPEC\n\npredicted environmental concentration\n\n\n\n\nRAR\n\nRenewal Assessment Report\n\n\n\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n"

        "summary": "Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed ( ) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on  ‐isoleucine produced by  ‐10641 (i) to renew the authorisation and to extend the use of the additive in water for drinking when used as a nutritional additive for all animal species and (ii) to evaluate a new use as a flavouring additive for all animal species. The applicant has provided evidence that the additive currently in the market complies with the existing conditions of authorisation.  ‐Isoleucine does not give rise to any safety concern regarding the production strain and its genetic modification. Considering that the production process has not been substantially modified and that no adverse effects have been reported in the literature search, the   Panel considers that there is no evidence to reconsider the conclusions reached in previous assessments. Therefore, the Panel considers that the additive  ‐isoleucine produced by  ‐10641 remains safe for the target species, consumer and for the environment when used as a nutritional additive in feed. The Panel extends these conclusions to the use of the additive as a flavouring compound. Regarding the use in water, the   Panel reiterates its concerns over the safety for the target species of  ‐isoleucine administered simultaneously via water for drinking and feed owing to the risk of nutritional imbalances and hygienic reasons.  ‐Isoleucine is not irritant to skin and eyes and is not a dermal sensitiser but is hazardous by inhalation. The Panel confirms the previous conclusions that the additive is considered as a source of available isoleucine for non‐ruminant animal species when used as a nutritional additive. It requires protection against degradation in the rumen to be as efficacious in ruminants as in non‐ruminant species. The Panel considers the use of the additive in water for drinking to be equally effective than the use in feed when used as a nutritional additive. Since  ‐isoleucine is used in food as a flavouring compound, and its function in feed is essentially the same as that in food no further demonstration of efficacy is necessary.",

        "summary": "Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of Availa Cr (active compound: chromium chelate of DL‐methionine) as a feed additive for dairy cows. The EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) Panel was assigned to this mandate. The tolerance study did not show adverse effects with respect to body weight, milk yield, haematology and blood biochemistry up to the 10‐fold overdose of chromium from Availa Cr; however, owing to deficiencies in design and reporting of the study, it provided only supportive evidence on the safety of the additive. A safe level for dairy cows could be derived from a toxicological study with laboratory rodents. Taking all together, the FEEDAP Panel considers the maximum recommended use level (8 mg Cr from Availa Cr/cow per day; about 0.4 mg Cr/kg complete feed) as safe. Chromium DL‐Met shows a genotoxic activity   that is not expressed   after systemic exposure; although no data on genotoxicity at the site of contact are available, the Panel notes that chromium(III) is not carcinogenic and concludes that chromium DL‐Met is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk at levels occurring in the diet. The use of Availa Cr in feed of dairy cows up to the recommended supplementation level would not measurably increase consumer exposure to chromium(III), and therefore is safe for consumers. The additive poses a risk to users by inhalation, it is not an irritant to skin and eyes and should be considered a sensitiser. The use of the additive is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

        "full-text": "Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on Safety and efficacy of Availa®Cr (chromium chelate of DL‐methionine) as a feed additive for dairy cows.The FEEDAP Panel used the data provided by the applicant and data from other previous risk assessments by EFSA or other expert bodies, peer‐reviewed scientific papers, other scientific reports and experts’ elicitation knowledge, to deliver the present output. This scientific opinion also included the summary of the European Union Reference Laboratory (EURL) report which relates to the methods used for the control of the additive in the feed. The FEEDAP Panel performed this assessment following the requirements of the Regulation (EC) No 429/2008 and the relevant EFSA guidance documents.The additive, brand name Availa®Cr, is intended to be used as a zootechnical feed additive for dairy cows to increase milk yield. ‘Chromium methionine chelate’ is considered the active compound and contains one molar equivalent of chromium (III) and three molar equivalents of DL‐Met; the final product incorporates the active substance dried onto a carrier.The additive is intended to be used in all types of feed (either mashed or pelleted form) for dairy cows. The applicant proposes its use at a minimum supplementation rate of 0.3 mg Cr/kg complete feed, up to a maximum of 0.5 mg Cr/kg complete feed (standard feed with 88% DM), corresponding to 300 and 500 mg Availa®Cr/kg complete feed, respectively. The FEEDAP Panel notes that the proposed chromium supplementation rate from Availa®Cr is close to the background content of complete feeds.Although in the tolerance study with dairy cows no adverse effects were seen with respect to body weight, milk yield, haematology and blood biochemistry at use level (8 mg Cr/cow and day) and the 5‐ and 10‐fold overdose of chromium from Availa®Cr, the FEEDAP Panel considers that this study provides only supportive evidence on the safety of the additive, owing to the significant deficiencies in design and reporting.On the other hand, a safe level in complete feed of dairy cows could be derived from a toxicological study with laboratory rodents showing a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 34 mg Cr from chromium DL‐Met/kg body weight per day; the safe level for dairy cows would be 9.7 mg supplemental Cr/kg complete feed. The maximum recommended use level (0.5 mg Cr/kg complete feed) would provide a margin of safety of about 19.Including the background chromium in feed (approximately the same magnitude as for the supplemental chromium from Availa®Cr) and presuming the same qualitative and quantitative efficacy as shown for chromium from the additive, the exposure of the animal would double being at least 10 times lower than the safe concentration.Taking all together, the FEEDAP Panel considers the maximum recommended use level for dairy cows (8 mg Cr from the additive Availa®Cr/cow per day) as safe for the target animal; this would correspond to about 0.4 mg Cr/kg complete feed.Absorption of chromium is low ranging from 0.5% to 2−3%. Upon absorption, it binds to plasma proteins and is transported to the liver. It is also found in spleen, kidneys, testes and bone. Deposition in muscle does occur to a very variable and low extent. Whereas most unabsorbed chromium is excreted through the faeces, urine is the main excretory route for absorbed chromium, but it is found in milk. Chromium DL‐Met shows a genotoxic activity in vitro that is not expressed in vivo after systemic exposure. Although no data on genotoxicity at the site of contact are available, the Panel notes that chromium(III) is not carcinogenic and concludes that chromium DL‐Met is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk at levels occurring in the diet.The use of chromium DL‐Met given as Availa®Cr in feed of dairy cows up to the recommended highest supplementation level would not measurably increase consumer exposure to trivalent chromium; therefore, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that the additive up to maximum recommended level of 0.5 mg Cr(III) from Availa®Cr per kg complete feed for dairy cows does not pose any concern to the safety of consumers.Based on the evaluation of data regarding the effects of the additive on the respiratory system and on the eyes and skin, the FEEDAP Panel conclude that the additive poses a risk to users by inhalation. Availa®Cr is not an irritant for skin and eyes. The additive should be considered a sensitiser.Chromium is as a natural constituent in many rocks ubiquitous in the environment. The contribution of chlorine from the additive to the total dietary chlorine is negligible. Methionine – a physiological and natural component in animals and plants – is not excreted by cows as such (but as urea, sulfate and carbon dioxide). The use of the additive is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.From the three studies submitted to support efficacy of the additive only one could be considered; the other two lacked critical data for the efficacy assessment. The efficacy study evaluated showed that supplementation of Availa®Cr before and after calving had a significant positive effect on milk production (more than 3 kg/day), with no changes in milk components and feed efficiency. Owing to the Guidance requirement of at least three studies showing positive effects, the FEEDAP Panel is not in a position to conclude on the efficacy of supplemental chromium from chromium‐chelate of DL‐Met.The FEEDAP Panel recommends to indicate a daily dose per dairy cow (8 mg Cr from Availa®Cr) under Other Provisions on a potential authorisation of the additive. The Panel added a remark concerning the analytical methods for the determination of supplemental chromium in compound feed.The additive, brand name Availa®Cr, contains chromium chelate of DL‐methionine (called in this opinion chromium DL‐Met) as active compound, and is intended to be used as a zootechnical feed additive for dairy cows to increase milk yield.10Unless otherwise indicated, chromium in the opinion refers to chromium(III).Although in the tolerance study with dairy cows no adverse effects were seen with respect to body weight, milk yield, haematology and blood biochemistry at use level (8 mg Cr/cow and day) and the 5‐ and 10‐fold overdose of chromium from Availa®Cr, the FEEDAP Panel considers that this study provides only supportive evidence on the safety of the additive, owing to the significant deficiencies in design and reporting.On the other hand, a safe level in complete feed for dairy cows of 9.7 mg supplemental Cr/kg feed could be derived from a toxicological study with laboratory rodents showing a NOAEL of 34 mg Cr from chromium DL‐Met/kg body weight per day; considering also the background chromium in feed the exposure of the animal would be at least ten times lower than the safe dietary chromium concentration.Taking all together, the FEEDAP Panel considers the maximum recommended use level for dairy cows (8 mg Cr from Availa®Cr/cow per day) as safe for the target animal. This would correspond to about 0.4 mg Cr/kg complete feed.Absorption of chromium is low ranging from 0.5% to 2−3%. Upon absorption, it binds to plasma proteins, and is transported to the liver.

Consequently, the Panel recommends characterising the additive as Availa®Cr containing 1,000 mg Cr from chromium DL‐Met/kg.The Panel notes that no analytical method is available to control the presence and supplementation rate of the zootechnical additive Availa®Cr in compound feed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nEvent\n\n\n\n\n23/04/2018\nDossier received by EFSA.

        "full-text": "One of the core tasks of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is to assess risks to human and animal health and/or the environment from regulated products/stressors linked to food and feed production; this includes genetically modified organisms (GMOs). EFSA fulfils this role primarily in two ways: (i) providing scientific advice on the safety of GMO market registration applications to the European Commission (EC) and European Union (EU) Member States on whose shoulders rests the responsibility to decide on authorisation; and (ii) issuing guidance for applicants on how to compile and present their applications including, for example, the data and other information that should be included for a structured risk assessment.In the field of biotechnology, EFSA is currently addressing three mandates from the European Commission that may have important implications for future GMO registrations in the EU and which are scheduled for completion by the end of 2020. The first of these is on gene drive which will be launched for public consultation in February 2020. Gene drives comprise genetic elements that can pass traits among sexually reproducing organisms at a frequency greater than the rate expected by simple Mendelian inheritance. The ability to engineer gene drives has sparked both enthusiasm and concerns among scientists and citizens. While engineered gene drives could be used to control agricultural pests and invasive species, rescue endangered species or supress disease vectors, there is concern that they may also have unintended effects and alter ecosystems in an irreversible manner. As potential future applications for the placement of GMOs on the EU market (including public use) may include the deliberate release of GMOs with engineered gene drives into the environment, the European Commission has identified the need for an in‐depth assessment of the adequacy of EFSA's existing guidelines for the molecular characterisation (MC) and environmental risk assessment (ERA) of gene drive‐modified organisms. EFSA organised a workshop1 in Brussels on 15 May 2019 to foster an open dialogue with stakeholders on the application of problem formulation methodology to the assessment of gene drives. The outcomes informed the EFSA GMO Panel's draft scientific opinion.The second mandate that EFSA is currently working on relates to synthetic biology (SynBio), an interdisciplinary field at the interface of engineering and biology. It employs an engineering‐based approach to build novel biological systems which have potential food and feed applications that would require authorisation in Europe. Some of those applications may include the deliberate release of genetically modified (GM) plants or GM microorganisms into the environment. As this is a fast‐evolving field, the European Commission has asked EFSA to evaluate the adequacy of its existing guidelines for the MC and ERA of GM plants and GM microorganisms obtained by SynBio. The mandate has been addressed via a case study approach, focusing on SynBio products that could reach the EU market within the next decade. This review is due for public consultation by the end of March 2020 and will address GM plants and GM microorganisms separately.The third mandate asks EFSA to assess its guidelines in relation to the biosafety of plants developed through type 1 and type 2 Site‐Directed Nucleases (SDN‐1 and SDN‐2) and oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis (ODM). These new genome editing tools form part of a broad range of molecular methods that can be used to introduce mutations into the plant genome, whereas Site‐Directed Nucleases type 3 (SDN‐3) facilitate the insertion of new pieces of DNA at a precise spot in the genome. In 2012, EFSA delivered a scientific opinion on SDN‐3 (EFSA GMO Panel, 2012). A ruling2 of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in 2018 clarified that the 2001 Directive on GMOs covered newer organisms obtained by mutagenesis techniques that have emerged since its adoption. EFSA has been mandated to assess whether its previous opinion on the safety of plants derived from SDN‐3 is still valid for those obtained through SDN‐1, SDN‐2 and ODM. The public consultation on this opinion is due to start in April 2020 at the latest, and the final output is scheduled for adoption by EFSA's GMO Panel by the end of October 2020.EFSA's scientific advice on gene drive, SynBio and genome editing will inform the EU's position under the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. Considering the broader societal debate on the potential applications of these advances in genetic engineering, EFSA aims to consult the widest possible number of stakeholders and interested parties and looks forward to receiving your inputs.To keep up to date with EFSA public consultations on these and other food safety topics, please visit https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/calls/consultations"

Therefore, for these 25 substances more detailed data on uses and use levels should be provided in order to refine their exposure assessments and to finalise their safety evaluations.",
        "full-text": "The present revision of this Flavouring Group Evaluation (FGE) concerns the inclusion of eight aliphatic, branched‐chain α,β‐unsaturated alcohols and aldehydes (i.e. [FL‐no: 02.174, 05.033, 05.090, 05.095, 05.105, 05.107, 05.114 and 05.126]) which have been evaluated with respect to genotoxicity in FGE.200Rev1 ([FL‐no: 05.114]) and FGE.201Rev2 ([FL‐no: 02.174, 05.033, 05.090, 05.095, 05.105, 05.107 and 05.126]). According to the Mandates and Terms of Reference of these FGEs, when for a flavouring substance the concern for genotoxicity is ruled out, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) proceeds to the full evaluation of these flavouring substances, taking into account the requirements of the Commission Regulation (EC) No 1565/20001 and of Regulation (EU) No 1334/20082.This revision 2 of FGE.72 comprises in total 31 JECFA‐evaluated flavouring substances, 23 of which have already been considered in FGE.72 and FGE.72Rev1. The remaining eight substances [FL‐no: 02.174, 05.033, 05.090, 05.095, 05.105, 05.107, 05.114 and 05.126] have been included in this revision, following evaluation in FGE.200Rev1 and FGE.201Rev2 of their genotoxic potential due to the presence of a structural alert for genotoxicity (i.e. α,β‐unsaturated carbonyl or precursors for that).Based on consideration of structural class, metabolism data, the absence of genotoxic potential in vivo and the MSDI exposure estimates, the FAF Panel concludes that the flavouring substances considered in this revision of FGE.72 (FGE.72Rev2) do not raise a safety concern at step A3 of the Procedure.For 10 substances, including the eight newly included flavouring substances in FGE.72Rev2 and two substances from the previous revision ([FL‐no: 05.169 and 09.931]), normal and maximum use levels have been provided. For six substances [FL‐ no: 02.174, 05.095, 05.114, 05.126, 05.169 and 09.931], the mTAMDI intake estimates are below the TTC for their structural class. For four substances, the mTAMDI intake estimates are equal to ([FL‐no: 05.090]) or above ([FL‐no: 05.107, 05.105, 05.033]) the TTC for their structural class. Therefore, for these four substances, more detailed data on uses and use levels should be provided in order to refine the exposure assessment and to finalise their safety evaluation.No normal and maximum use levels have been provided for the remaining 21 flavouring substances [FL‐no: 02.011, 02.012, 02.027, 02.029, 02.058, 02.076, 02.109, 05.020, 05.021, 05.124, 05.148, 08.036, 08.044, 08.047, 08.055, 08.064, 08.070, 08.079, 09.273, 09.408 and 16.001], previously considered in FGE.72Rev1. Therefore, for these 21 substances, normal and maximum use levels are needed to calculate the mTAMDI estimates in order to identify those flavouring substances that need more refined exposure assessment and to finalise the evaluation accordingly.To determine whether the conclusions for the 31 JECFA‐evaluated substances can be applied to the materials of commerce, it is necessary to consider the available specifications. Adequate specifications, including complete purity criteria and identity, are available for all the 31 flavouring substances in FGE.72Rev2.In conclusion, for all 31 flavouring substances in FGE.72Rev2, the Panel agrees with JECFA conclusions ‘No safety concern at estimated levels of intake as flavouring substances’ based on the MSDI approach. For 21 substances, use levels are still needed to calculate the mTAMDI estimates. For four substances, the mTAMDI intake estimates are equal to ([FL‐no: 05.090]) or above ([FL‐no: 05.107, 05.105, 05.033]) the TTC for their structural class. Therefore, for these 25 flavouring substances more detailed data on uses and use levels should be provided in order to finalise their safety evaluations.The Panel recommends the European Commission to consider:\n\n\n•to request normal and maximum use levels for [FL‐no: 02.011, 02.012, 02.027, 02.029, 02.058, 02.076, 02.109, 05.020, 05.021, 05.124, 05.148, 08.036, 08.044, 08.047, 08.055, 08.064, 08.070, 08.079, 09.273, 09.408 and 16.001];\n\n•to request more detailed data on uses and use levels for substances [FL‐no: 05.033, 05.090, 05.105, and 05.107]. When these data are received, the assessment for these flavouring substances should be updated accordingly and expanded if necessary (i.e. request of additional toxicology data);\n\n•in accordance with the latest specifications for the materials of commerce provided by industry:\n\na)to change the chemical names and/or the CAS numbers in the Union List for flavouring substance [FL‐no: 02.174, 05.033, 05.090, 05.095, 05.105, 05.107 and 05.126] to reflect their stereochemical configuration (see Table B.1 of Appendix B);\n\nb)to update the purity requirements in the Union List for flavouring substances [FL‐no: 05.090 and 05.126] (see Table B.1 of Appendix B).\n\n• to change the CAS number in the Union List for flavouring substance [FL‐no: 09.931], previously considered in FGE.72Rev1, to 197098‐61‐6 as the currently reported CAS number is not existing.

        "summary": "The Panel on Food Additives and Flavourings (FAF) provided a scientific opinion re‐evaluating the safety of stearyl tartrate (E 483) as a food additive. The previously evaluated toxicological studies were not available, in addition to no genotoxicity data being available. Thus, adequate toxicity data on stearyl tartrate were not available for its re‐evaluation. In addition, adequate data demonstrating the complete hydrolysis of stearyl tartrate (E 483) in the gastrointestinal tract and/or presystemically, that could allow read‐across from data on its constituents, were lacking. Therefore, the safety of the use of stearyl tartrate as a food additive could not be assessed and the acceptable intake established by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) in 1978 could not be confirmed. Exposure to stearyl tartrate (E 483) was calculated using the maximum level exposure assessment scenario as neither use levels nor analytical data were available. Mean exposure to stearyl tartrate (E 483) as a food additive ranged from 0.1 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day in infants to 82.5 mg/kg bw per day in toddlers. The 95th percentile of exposure ranged from 0 mg/kg bw per day in adults to 192.7 mg/kg bw per day in toddlers. The Panel also noted that information from the Mintel's GNPD indicates that only two products have been labelled with stearyl tartrate (E 483) since 1996. Some recommendations were proposed by the Panel.",
        "full-text": "Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Food Additives and Flavourings (FAF) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the re‐evaluation of the safety of stearyl tartrate (E 483) used as a food additive. The present opinion document deals with the re‐evaluation of stearyl tartrate (E 483) when used as a food additive.Stearyl tartrate (E 483) is an authorised food additive in the European Union (EU) according to Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and specifications have been defined in the Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 and by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in 2006. Stearyl tartrate (E 483) has been previously evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) in 1978 and by JECFA in 1965. The SCF allocated an acceptable daily intake of 1,200 mg/adult per day, corresponding to 20 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day for an adult weighing 60 kg.Stearyl tartrate (E 483) is defined by Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 as ‘Product of the esterification of tartaric acid with commercial stearyl alcohol, which consists essentially of stearyl and palmityl alcohols. It consists mainly of diester, with minor amounts of monoester and of unchanged starting materials’. The Panel noted that the name ‘stearyl tartrate’ for E 483 does not reflect the composition of the food additive since it is a mixture of three different esters (distearyl tartrate, dipalmityl tartrate and stearylpalmityl tartrate).Apart from the specifications given in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 and by JECFA, there was only minor information available relating to the manufacturing process of stearyl tartrate (E 483). The Panel considered that only l(+)‐tartaric acid should be used in the manufacturing process of stearyl tartrate (E 483).The limited available absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) data are not sufficient to confirm the extent of hydrolysis of stearyl tartrate in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and presystemically or the extent of absorption or metabolism. In the absence of additional data, the Panel noted that kinetic fate of this food additive remains uncertain. Therefore, read‐across from data on its constituents is not applicable.No short‐term toxicity, subchronic toxicity or genotoxicity data was available.The Panel considered the information on chronic toxicity and reproduction summarised in the JECFA evaluation in 1965, inadequate for hazard identification. The toxicological studies were not available. No genotoxicity data were available to the Panel; however, no relevant structural alert for genotoxicity was found analysing distearyl l(+)‐tartrate, stearylpalmityl l(+)‐tartrate and dipalmityl l(+)‐tartrate through the OECD QSAR toolbox (version 4.3).Food consumption data derived from the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database was used to estimate the dietary exposure to stearyl tartrate (E 483). In response to the call for data, no concentration data for stearyl tartrate (E 483) in foods was made available by the Member States or Industry or other interested parties. The Panel noted that the lack of reported use levels was in line with the data obtained from the Mintel's Global New Products Database (GNPD), where only two entries in total were observed for stearyl tartrate since 1996. As a result, exposure assessment to stearyl tartrate (E 483) was carried out based on maximum permitted levels, known as the maximum level exposure assessment scenario. Mean exposure to stearyl tartrate (E 483) ranged from 0.1 mg/kg bw per day in infants to 82.5 mg/kg bw per day in toddlers. The 95th percentile of exposure ranged from 0 mg/kg bw per day in adults to 192.7 mg/kg bw per day in toddlers. The Panel considered that the exposure to stearyl tartrate (E 483) was an overestimation, due to the assumption that the food additive is used at maximum permitted level in each authorised food category.The Panel concluded that there was inadequate toxicity data on stearyl tartrate (E 483), in addition to a lack of adequate data demonstrating its complete hydrolysis in the GI tract and/or presystematically that could allow read‐across from data on its constituents. As a result, its safety as a food additive could not be assessed and the acceptable intake of 20 mg/kg bw per day established by the SCF in 1978 could not be confirmed.The Panel made a number of recommendations: confirmation that stearyl tartrate (E 483) is used by industry, and if confirmed, information on use and use levels should be made available in order to perform a refined exposure assessment; that data showing complete presystematic hydrolysis and/or appropriate toxicity studies be made available in order to assess the safety of stearyl tartrate (E 483); that the European Commission consider revising the EU specifications for stearyl tartrate (E 483) to specify that only l(+)‐tartaric acid can be used in the manufacturing process; that the European Commission should consider setting lower maximum limits for toxic elements in the EU specifications for stearyl tartrate (E 483) to ensure that its use as a food additive will not be a significant source of exposure to these toxic elements in food; and finally that the European Commission consider revising the name of E 483 since it is a mixture of three different esters.The present opinion document deals with the re‐evaluation of stearyl tartrate (E 483) when used as a food additive.In 1978, the SCF considered acceptable an intake of 1,200 mg stearyl tartrate per adult per day, corresponding to 20 mg/kg bw per day for an adult weighing 60 kg. The rational for this conclusion was, however, not provided in the SCF report.Commission Regulation 231/2012 does not stipulate which isomer of tartaric acid should be used for the manufacturing process of stearyl tartrate (E 483) and, therefore, currently any isomer of tartaric acid can be used. The Panel considered that only l(+)‐tartaric acid should be used in the manufacturing process of stearyl tartrate (E 483).The Panel noted that the name ‘stearyl tartrate’ for E 483 (Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012) does not reflect the composition of the food additive since it is a mixture of three different esters (distearyl tartrate, dipalmityl tartrate and stearylpalmityl tartrate).The Panel noted that neither technical or biological data nor information on current use levels have been submitted in response to any of the EFSA public calls for data.6–8The limited available ADME data are not sufficient to confirm the extent of hydrolysis of stearyl tartrate in the GI tract and presystemically or the extent of absorption or metabolism. In the absence of additional data, the Panel noted that the kinetic fate of this food additive remains uncertain. Therefore, read‐across from data on its constituents is not applicable.JECFA in its latest evaluation concluded that ‘either the original toxicological and metabolic studies should be made available or that new studies demonstrating hydrolysis in vivo should be submitted before the substance could be re‐evaluated’ (JECFA, 2001). Also, TemaNord had recommended that data on hydrolysis of stearyl tartrate were required to show whether or not the supposed hydrolysis to constituents takes place (TemaNord, 2002).The toxicological studies evaluated by JECFA in 1965 were not available. The Panel considered the information on chronic toxicity and reproduction summarised by JECFA (1965) inadequate for hazard identification. No genotoxicity data were available to the Panel, however, no relevant structural alert for genotoxicity was found analysing distearyl l(+)‐tartrate, stearylpalmityl l(+)‐tartrate and dipalmityl l(+)‐tartrate through the OECD QSAR toolbox (version 4.3).Due to the absence of use levels and analytical data, the exposure to stearyl tartrate (E 483) from the four authorised food categories was estimated using the regulatory maximum level exposure assessment scenario. The calculated exposure was maximally 82.5 mg/kg bw per day at the mean and 193 mg/kg bw per day at the high level (p95), both in toddlers. Based on the information from the Mintel's GNPD, the Panel presumed that the food additive is rarely used and in the absence of data on uses and use levels, the Panel was unable to perform a refined exposure assessment.The Panel concluded that adequate toxicity data on stearyl tartrate were not available for its re‐evaluation. In addition, adequate data demonstrating the complete hydrolysis of stearyl tartrate (E 483) in the GI tract and/or presystemically, that could allow read‐across from data on its constituents, were lacking. Therefore, its safety of use as a food additive cannot be assessed and the acceptable intake established by the SCF in 1978 cannot be confirmed.The Panel recommended that:\n\nthe use of stearyl tartrate (E 483) by industry, considering the low number of labelled uses in the Mintel's GNPD (n = 2), should be confirmed. If confirmed, information on use and use levels should be made available in order to perform a refined exposure assessment.\ndata showing complete presystemic hydrolysis and/or appropriate toxicity studies should be made available in accordance with the Guidance on the submission of food additives (EFSA ANS Panel, 2012), in order to assess the safety of stearyl tartrate (E 483).\nthe European Commission should consider revising the EU specifications for stearyl tartrate (E 483) by specifying that only l‐tartaric acid can be used in the manufacturing process.\nthe European Commission should consider setting lower maximum limits for toxic elements (arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury) in the EU specifications for stearyl tartrate (E 483) in order to ensure that their use as a food additive will not be a significant source of exposure to these toxic elements in food.\nthe European Commission should consider revising the name of the food additive E 483 since is a mixture of three different esters (distearyl tartrate, dipalmityl tartrate and stearylpalmityl tartrate), e.g. stearyl palmityl tartrate.\n\n\n\nPre‐evaluation document prepared by the Fraunhofer ITEM.

The current Scientific Opinion covers all plant health risks posed by bare rooted plants for planting of   (1 year old with a stem diameter of less than 2.5 cm) imported from Israel, taking into account the available scientific information, including the technical information provided by Israel by 26 December 2019. The relevance of an  ‐quarantine pest for this opinion was based on evidence that: (i) the pest is present in Israel; (ii)   is a host of the pest, and (iii) the pest can be associated with the commodity. The relevance of this opinion for other non  ‐regulated pests was based on evidence that: (i) the pest is present in Israel (ii) the pest is absent in the  ; (iii)   is a host of the pest; (iv) the pest can be associated with the commodity and (v) the pest may have an impact and can pose a potential risk for the   territory. Two pests (one insect and one fungus,   and  ) that fulfilled all criteria were selected for further evaluation. For the two selected pests, the risk mitigation measures proposed in the technical dossier from Israel were evaluated. Limiting factors in the effectiveness of the measures were documented. For the selected pests an expert judgement is given on the likelihood of pest freedom taking into consideration the risk mitigation measures acting on the pest, including uncertainties associated with the assessment, therefore the Panel is 95% sure that 9,950 or more plants per 10,000 will be free from these two pests.",

        "summary": "The   Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes and Processing Aids ( ) assessed the safety of the recycling process Ltd. Poly  (  register number  175), which uses the Starlinger de  technology. The input material is hot washed and dried poly(ethylene terephthalate) ( ) flakes originating from collected post‐consumer   containers, mainly bottles, with less than 5%   from non‐food consumer applications. The flakes are preheated before being submitted to solid‐state polycondensation ( ) in a continuous reactor at high temperature under vacuum and gas flow. Having examined the challenge test provided, the Panel concluded that the preheating (step 2) and the decontamination in the continuous   reactor (step 3) are the critical steps that determine the decontamination efficiency of the process. The operating parameters to control the performance of these critical steps are temperature, pressure, residence time and gas flow rate. It was demonstrated that this recycling process is able to ensure that the level of migration of potential unknown contaminants into food is below the conservatively modelled migration of 0.1 μg/kg food. Therefore, the Panel concluded that the recycled   obtained from this process is not considered of safety concern, when used at up to 100% for the manufacture of materials and articles for contact with all types of foodstuffs for long‐term storage at room temperature, with or without hotfill. Trays made of this recycled   are not intended to be used in microwave and conventional ovens and such uses are not covered by this evaluation.",

The input material is hot caustic washed and dried poly(ethylene terephthalate) ( ) flakes originating from collected post‐consumer   containers including no more than 5%   from non‐food consumer applications. The flakes are heated in a continuous reactor under vacuum before being extruded. The Panel concluded that the continuous reactor (step 2, for which a challenge test was provided), is critical in determining the decontamination efficiency of the process. The operating parameters that control the performance of this step are temperature, pressure and residence time. It was demonstrated that this recycling process is able to ensure a level of migration of potential unknown contaminants into food below the conservatively modelled migration of 0.1 μg/kg food derived from the exposure scenario for infants when such recycled   is used at up to 100%. Therefore, the Panel concluded that the recycled   obtained from this process is not of safety concern when used at up to 100% for the manufacture of materials and articles for contact with all types of foodstuffs, including drinking water, for long‐term storage at room temperature, with or without hotfill.

The context of the peer review was that required by Commission Implementing Regulation ( ) No 844/2012, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation ( ) No 2018/1659. The conclusions were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of kieselgur (diatomaceous earth) as an insecticide and acaricide on stored cereals, empty storage rooms and storage rooms, mills and warehouses (with stored goods). The reliable end points, appropriate for use in regulatory risk assessment, are presented. Missing information identified as being required by the regulatory framework is listed.",
        "full-text": "Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/1659, lays down the procedure for the renewal of the approval of active substances submitted under Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. The list of those substances is established in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 686/2012 as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2016/183. Kieselgur (diatomaceous earth) is one of the active substances listed in that Regulation.In accordance with Article 1 of Regulation (EU) No 844/2012, the rapporteur Member State (RMS), Austria, and co‐rapporteur Member State (co‐RMS), Greece, received an application from Biofa AG for the renewal of approval of the active substance kieselgur. In addition, the applicant submitted an application for inclusion of the substance in Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.An initial evaluation of the dossier on kieselgur was provided by the RMS in the renewal assessment report (RAR) and subsequently, a peer review of the pesticide risk assessment on the RMS evaluation was conducted by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in accordance with Article 13 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/1659. The following conclusions are derived.The uses of kieselgur according to the representative uses as an insecticide and acaricide on stored cereals, empty storage rooms and storage rooms with stored goods, as proposed at the European Union (EU) level, result in a sufficient insecticidal and acaricidal efficacy against the target organisms.The assessment of the data package revealed no issues that need to be included as critical areas of concern with respect to the identity, physical, chemical and technical properties of kieselgur or the representative formulations.There are no critical areas of concern identified in the mammalian toxicology area if operator exposure is compared with a refined acceptable operator exposure concentration (AOEC) that is derived with a reduced uncertainty factor taking into consideration the specificity of kieselgur, i.e. concerns limited to local effects in the lungs upon repeated exposure through inhalation and specific use in stored cereals and storage rooms where bystanders and residents are not exposed. However, even with this refinement, estimated operator exposure exceeds the AOEC for two of the four representative uses.No risk to consumer via intake is expected from the representative uses of the kieselgur on stored cereals and empty storage rooms. This assessment covers the most critical authorised uses on stored cereals and empty storage from European Member States. Due to the nature of kieselgur, no maximum residue levels (MRLs) are needed and EFSA recommends its inclusion in the Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.An MRL application for inclusion of kieselgur into Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 has also been submitted.Environmental exposure is not expected for the indoor uses of kieselgur.A low risk to birds, wild mammals, aquatic organisms, bees, non‐target arthropods other than bees, earthworms, soil organisms, non‐target terrestrial plants and sewage treatment organisms is concluded for all the representative uses.Kieselgur does not meet the criteria for endocrine disruption for humans and non‐target organisms through estrogen, androgen, thyroid, steroidogenic (EATS) modalities as set out in points 3.6.5 and 3.8.2 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) 2018/605.Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012,1 as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/16592 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Regulation’), lays down the provisions for the procedure of the renewal of the approval of active substances, submitted under Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.3 This regulates for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) the procedure for organising the consultation of Member States, the applicant(s) and the public on the initial evaluation provided by the rapporteur Member State (RMS) and/or co‐rapporteur Member State (co‐RMS) in the renewal assessment report (RAR), and the organisation of an expert consultation where appropriate.In accordance with Article 13 of the Regulation, unless formally informed by the European Commission that a conclusion is not necessary, EFSA is required to adopt a conclusion on whether the active substance can be expected to meet the approval criteria provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 within 5 months from the end of the period provided for the submission of written comments, subject to an extension of an additional 3 months where additional information is required to be submitted by the applicant(s) in accordance with Article 13(3). Furthermore, in accordance with Article 13(3a), where the information available in the dossier is not sufficient to conclude the assessment on whether the approval criteria for endocrine disruption are met, additional information can be requested to be submitted in a period of minimum 3 months, not exceeding 30 months, depending on the type of information requested.In accordance with Article 1 of the Regulation, the RMS Austria and co‐RMS Greece received an application from Biofa AG for the renewal of approval of the active substance kieselgur (diatomaceous earth). In addition, Biofa AG submitted an application to include the substance into Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.4 Complying with Article 8 of the Regulation, the RMS checked the completeness of the dossier and informed the applicant, the co‐RMS (Greece), the European Commission and EFSA about the admissibility.The RMS provided its initial evaluation of the dossier on kieselgur in the RAR, which was received by EFSA on 22 February 2019 (Austria, 2019a). Furthermore, this conclusion also addresses the assessment required from EFSA under Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. On 19 August 2019, EFSA invited the Member States to submit their Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) that are authorised nationally, in the format of specific GAP forms. All the GAPs were collected by EFSA and they are made publicly available as a background document to this conclusion, in the format of a specific GAP overview file.In accordance with Article 12 of the Regulation, EFSA distributed the RAR to the Member States and the applicant, Biofa AG, for consultation and comments on 29 March 2019. EFSA also provided comments. In addition, EFSA conducted a public consultation on the RAR. EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the European Commission on 29 May 2019. At the same time, the collated comments were forwarded to the RMS for compilation and evaluation in the format of reporting table. The applicant was invited to respond to the comments in column 3 of the reporting table. The comments and the applicants’ response were evaluated by the RMS in column 3.The need for expert consultation and the necessity for additional information to be submitted by the applicant in accordance with Article 13(3) of the Regulation were considered in a telephone conference between EFSA and the RMS on 15 July 2019. On the basis of the comments received, the applicant's response to the comments and the RMS's evaluation thereof, it was concluded that additional information should be requested from the applicant, and that EFSA should conduct an expert consultation in the area of mammalian toxicology.The outcome of the telephone conference, together with EFSA's further consideration of the comments, is reflected in the conclusions set out in column 4 of the reporting table. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase and which required further consideration, including those issues to be considered in an expert consultation, were compiled by EFSA in the format of an evaluation table.The conclusions arising from the consideration by EFSA, and as appropriate by the RMS, of the points identified in the evaluation table, together with the outcome of the expert consultation and the written consultation on the assessment of additional information, where these took place, were reported in the final column of the evaluation table.A final consultation on the conclusions arising from the peer review of the risk assessment and on the Article 12 MRL review of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, took place with Member States via a written procedure in January‐February 2020.This conclusion report summarises the outcome of the peer review of the risk assessment of the active substance and the representative formulation, evaluated on the basis of the representative uses of kieselgur as an insecticide and acaricide on stored cereals, empty storage rooms and storage rooms, mills and warehouses (with stored goods), as proposed by the applicant. In accordance with Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, risk mitigation options identified in the RAR and considered during the peer review, if any, are presented in the conclusion. A list of the relevant end points for the active substance and the formulation is provided in Appendix A.A key supporting document to this conclusion is the peer review report (EFSA, 2020), which is a compilation of the documentation developed to evaluate and address all issues raised in the peer review, from the initial commenting phase to the conclusion. The peer review report comprises the following documents, in which all views expressed during the course of the peer review, including minority views, where applicable, can be found:\n\nthe comments received on the RAR;\nthe reporting table (15 July 2019);\nthe evaluation table (14 February 2020);\nthe report of the scientific consultation with Member State experts (where relevant);\nthe comments received on the assessment of the additional information (where relevant);\nthe comments received on the draft EFSA conclusion.\nGiven the importance of the RAR, including its revisions (Austria, 2019b), and the peer review report, both documents are considered as background documents to this conclusion and thus are made publicly available.It is recommended that this conclusion report and its background documents would not be accepted to support any registration outside the European Union (EU) for which the applicant has not demonstrated that it has regulatory access to the information on which this conclusion report is based.Kieselgur (diatomaceous earth) is considered by the International Organization for Standardization not to require a common name. It consists mainly of silicon dioxide (IUPAC).The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ‘SilicoSec’, a contact powder (CP), containing 1,000 g/kg kieselgur.The representative uses evaluated comprise applications by mixing with stored cereal grain during putting into storage and by dusting in empty storage rooms and storage rooms with stored cereals, as insecticide/acaricide, for the control of insects and mites. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of end points in Appendix A.Data were submitted to conclude that the representative uses of kieselgur proposed at EU level result in a sufficient insecticidal and acaricidal efficacy against the target organisms, following the guidance document SANCO/2012/11251‐rev. 4 (European Commission, 2014)A data gap has been identified for a search of the scientific peer‐reviewed open literature on the active substance and its relevant metabolites, dealing with side effects on health and non‐target species and published within the 10 years before the date of submission of the dossier, to be conducted and reported in accordance with EFSA guidance on the submission of scientific peer‐reviewed open literature for the approval of pesticide active substances under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 (EFSA, 2011).The following guidance documents were followed in the production of this conclusion: European Commission, 2000a,b.It should be noted that the active substance is constituted of mined diatomaceous earth. The active substance kieselgur consists of 1,000 g/kg diatomaceous earth with a minimum content of amorphous silica of 800 g/kg. Crystalline silica with diameter below 10 μm was defined as relevant impurity with a maximum limit of 1 g/kg. FAO specification does not exist. Considering the changes in the expression of the purity and the changes in the relevant impurity definition, it is proposed to update the reference specification.The available data regarding the identity of kieselgur and its physical and chemical properties are given in Appendix A. Appropriate analytical methods exist for the determination of the composition of the technical product and the identical formulation. Crystalline silica in kieselgur technical and formulation can be determined by X‐ray diffraction analysis.The need for methods of analysis for monitoring this compound in food of plant and animal origin, in the environment and in body fluids and tissues has been waived due to the nature of the compound. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP‐OES) and NIOSH X‐ray diffraction method can be used for the determination of the crystalline silicon dioxide in the air.The following guidance documents were followed in the production of this conclusion: European Commission, 2003, 2012, EFSA PPR Panel, 2012 and ECHA, 2017.Kieselgur was discussed during the Pesticides Peer Review Experts’ Meeting 18 in November 2019.One relevant impurity, crystalline silica with diameter below 10 μm, is considered a human carcinogen by inhalation, self‐classified (classification proposed by registrants) as Carc. 1A (H350 ‘May cause cancer by inhalation’ according to Regulation (EC) No 1272/20085) and needs to remain below 1 g/kg.Considering the intrinsic physico‐chemical properties of kieselgur (insoluble and inert), the rate and extension of oral absorption is considered to be negligible and no metabolism is expected to occur. In addition, no adverse effects were observed upon oral administration (see below). On this basis, the submission of additional toxicological studies performed by the oral route was waived, such as toxicokinetic studies, long‐term toxicity, carcinogenicity or reproductive toxicity.Acute toxicity studies were submitted confirming the low toxicity of the substance when administered by the oral or inhalation routes. No potential for skin or eye irritation was observed. No genotoxic potential on lung and stomach cells was seen in an intratracheal Comet assay performed with kieselgur in rats.With regard to short term toxicity, kieselgur was tested in a 90‐day oral toxicity study in rats, where no adverse effects were observed at dose levels exceeding 4,000 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day. In a 28‐day study by inhalation, kieselgur administration of 5 mg diatomaceous earth/m³ per six hours/day resulted in adverse local effects characterised by increased lung weight, accumulation of macrophages and changes in macrophage and neutrophil counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. The respective no‐observed adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) was identified at 1 mg/m3. Additional short‐term toxicity studies by inhalation, reproductive and developmental toxicity studies by the oral route were provided for similar substances (silica (aero)gel, synthetic amorphous silica, fumed hydrophobic silica) showing a similar toxicity profile as kieselgur, i.e. no adverse effects were observed after oral administration, while similar inflammatory lung responses were induced by inhalation. These studies were considered supplementary information since uncertainties were identified to allow read across between the different silica derivatives due to their different physico‐chemical properties.Since no concern was identified if kieselgur is administered by the oral route, the same lack of toxicity is expected through dermal exposure taking into consideration the insoluble and inert properties of the active substance.Toxicological reference values related to oral exposure were not considered necessary, i.e. acceptable daily intake (ADI), acute reference dose (ARfD) or (acute) acceptable operator exposure level (AAOEL/AOEL), and were not established. It was, however, agreed that, considering the toxicity profile of the substance by inhalation, an acceptable operator exposure concentration (AOEC) was needed to perform a non‐dietary risk assessment related to inhalation exposure. These conclusions are in agreement with the previous conclusion of the peer review (EFSA, 2012).Taking into consideration the minimum safety margin of 100 according to point 3.6.1 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the AOEC should be 0.01 mg/m3 based on the NOAEC of 1 mg/m3 from the 28‐day toxicity study by inhalation in rats. This conclusion is in agreement with the conclusion reached under the confirmatory data procedure (EFSA, 2016). The experts considered however that this uncertainty factor does not reflect the specificity of kieselgur, i.e. concerns only upon repeated exposure by inhalation and specific indoor uses where bystanders and residents are not exposed – and agreed that an overall reduced uncertainty factor of 12.5 is more appropriate, 5 to account for intraspecies variability (because only professionals are exposed and not more sensitive groups included in residents and bystanders6 ) and 2.5 for interspecies variability in toxicodynamics (toxicokinetic not being relevant for local effects in the lungs). The resulting refined AOEC is 0.06 mg/m3 based on the same 28‐day subacute toxicity study in rats normalised for 8 hours exposure as the NOAEC is derived from 6 hours inhalation exposure study.7 It is noted that the basis of this conclusion is in line with the short‐term reference value established by the biocides review, the difference between the two values being due to the population covered (the biocide value is protective of the general population while the AOEC value agreed as plant protection product is applicable to professional users, relevant to the representative use only), i.e. short‐term acceptable exposure concentration (AECshort‐term) of 0.03 mg/m3 per day.8 This timeframe was considered to cover the representative uses. No acute AOEC was established as it was not needed.Kieselgur is proposed to be used in stored cereals, empty storage rooms or storage rooms, mills and warehouses with stored goods. The EFSA calculator does not cover this type of applications and non‐dietary exposure was calculated according to the Technical Notes for Guidance (TNsG) for biocides9 which is based on the same set of exposure data also used for the German model and use the same breathing rate of 1.25 m3/h for operators as recommended in the EFSA guidance (EFSA, 2014). For the use in stored cereals (mixing with grains), the operator exposure estimates are above the AOEC of 0.01 mg/m3, even when personal protective equipment (PPE) such as respiratory protective equipment (RPE) is used. When compared with the refined AOEC of 0.06 mg/m3, the use of respiratory protective equipment is sufficient to ensure that the AOEC is not exceeded. Worker exposure by inhalation was considered negligible for this use since the product remains as a solid coating on the treated cereals. Bystander and resident's exposures were considered not relevant.Regarding uses in empty storage rooms or storage rooms, mills and warehouses (with stored goods), estimated exposure always exceeded the AOEC, either of 0.01 or 0.06 mg/m3, even when operators wear RPE. For these uses, worker exposure was not considered relevant because re‐entry is not necessary shortly after spraying. As for the previous uses, bystander and resident's exposure are not considered relevant.Kieselgur occurs naturally and toxicologically is considered not relevant for the consumer since the setting of reference values (ADI, ARfD) were not necessary (see Section 2). No risk consumer via dietary intake is expected as the relevant impurity of kieselgur (crystalline silica) is classified as carcinogenic by inhalation. Due to the inert and insoluble properties, kieselgur is not expected to degrade or to form other metabolites relevant for the consumer when used as plant protection product.The review of existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) under Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 is covered by the assessment of the representative uses on stored cereals and empty storage rooms since the most critical authorised uses from the European Member States are similar. EFSA recommends the inclusion of kieselgur in the Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 and no MRLs are necessary for this active substance.Due to the nature of the substance and the uses in closed environments (silos, mills, empty rooms), the exposure of kieselgur to soil, water and air is not expected.Given that environmental exposure is not expected from the indoor uses of kieselgur, a low risk is concluded to birds, wild mammals, aquatic organisms, bees, non‐target arthropods other than bees, earthworms, soil organisms, non‐target terrestrial plants and sewage treatment organisms. This conclusion applies to all representative uses.The assessment of the endocrine disruption potential of kieselgur was conducted in accordance with ECHA/EFSA guidance (2018).Kieselgur has a non‐toxic mode of action and is non‐toxic by itself by the oral route. Although no (eco)toxicological data are available to assess the endocrine disrupting properties of kieselgur for humans and non‐target organisms, this does not appear scientifically necessary considering the nature of the substance, being insoluble and inert. Therefore, it is considered scientifically justified to waive the assessment of endocrine disrupting properties of this substance both for humans and non‐target organisms.Considering the above, it can be concluded that kieselgur does not meet the criteria for endocrine disruption through EATS modalities for humans and non‐target organisms according to points 3.6.5 and 3.8.2 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) 2018/60510.This is a list of data gaps identified during the peer review process, including those areas in which a study may have been made available during the peer review process but not considered for procedural reasons (without prejudice to the provisions of Article 56 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 concerning information on potentially harmful effects).\n\n\nA search of the scientific peer‐reviewed open literature on the active substance and its relevant metabolites, dealing with side effects on health and non‐target species and published within the 10 years before the date of submission of the dossier, to be conducted and reported in accordance with EFSA guidance on the submission of scientific peer‐reviewed open literature for the approval of pesticide active substances under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 (EFSA, 2011; relevant for all representative uses evaluated, see sections 211 and 512).\n\n\n\n\nOperators exposed to kieselgur in stored cereals (mixing it with grains) need to use RPE to ensure that the refined AOEC of 0.06 mg/m3 (taking into consideration a reduced uncertainty factor due to the specificity of kieselgur, i.e. concerns limited to local effects in the lungs upon repeated exposure through inhalation and specific use in stored cereals and storage rooms) is not exceeded (see Section 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAAOEL\n\nacute acceptable operator exposure level\n\n\n\n\nADI\n\nacceptable daily intake\n\n\n\n\nAOEC\n\nacceptable operator exposure concentration\n\n\n\n\nAOEL\n\nacceptable operator exposure level\n\n\n\n\nARfD\n\nacute reference dose\n\n\n\n\nBAL\n\nbronchoalveolar lavage\n\n\n\n\nbw\n\nbody weight\n\n\n\n\nDAR\n\ndraft assessment report\n\n\n\n\nEATS\n\nestrogen, androgen, thyroid, steroidogenic\n\n\n\n\nECHA\n\nEuropean Chemicals Agency\n\n\n\n\nEEC\n\nEuropean Economic Community\n\n\n\n\nFAO\n\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n\n\n\n\nFOCUS\n\nForum for the Co‐ordination of Pesticide Fate Models and their Use\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nICP‐OES\n\ninductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy\n\n\n\n\nIUPAC\n\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n\n\n\n\nLC50\n\nlethal concentration, median\n\n\n\n\nMRL\n\nmaximum residue level\n\n\n\n\nNOAEC\n\nno observed adverse effect concentration\n\n\n\n\nPPE\n\npersonal protective equipment\n\n\n\n\nRAR\n\nRenewal Assessment Report\n\n\n\n\nRMS\n\nrapporteur Member State\n\n\n\n\nRPE\n\nrespiratory protective equipment\n\n\n\n\nTNsG\n\ntechnical notes of guidance (biocides)\n\n\n"

        "summary": "Between 16 November 2019 and 15 February 2020, 36 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N8) virus outbreakswere reported in Europe in poultry (n=34), captive birds (n=1) and wild birds (n=2), in Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, Germany, Czechiaand Ukraine,one HPAI outbreakcaused by a simultaneous infection with A(H5N2) and A(H5N8) was reported in poultry in Bulgaria, andtwo low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A(H5) virus outbreaks were reported in poultryin the United Kingdom and in Denmark. Genomic characterisation of the HPAI A(H5N8) viruses suggests that they are reassortants of HPAI A(H5N8) viruses from Africa and LPAI viruses from Eurasia. It is likely that this reassortment occurred in wild migratory birds in Asia during the summer and then spread to eastern Europe with the autumnmigration. This is the first time that wild bird migration from Africa to Eurasia has been implicated in the long‐distance spread of HPAI viruses to the EU. Given the late incursion of HPAI A(H5N8) virus into the EU in this winter season (first outbreak reported on 30 December 2019), its overall restriction to eastern Europe, and the approaching spring migration, the risk of the virus spreadingfurther in the west via wild birds is decreasing for the coming months. Genetic analysis of the HPAI A(H5N2) and A(H5N8) viruses detected in the Bulgarian outbreak reveals that these virusesare both related to the 2018‐19 Bulgarian HPAI A(H5N8) viruses and not to the HPAI A(H5N8) viruses currently circulating in Europe.An increasing number of HPAI A(H5N1), A(H5N2), A(H5N5) and A(H5N6) virus outbreaks in poultry in Asia were reported during the time period for this report compared with the previous reporting period. Single outbreaks of HPAI A(H5N8) virus were notified by Saudi Arabia and South Africa. Furthermore, in contrast to the last report, HPAI virus‐positive wild birds were reported from Israel and one of the key migration areas in northern China.Two human cases due to A(H9N2) virus infection were reported during the reporting period.",

In particular, Article 10(2) of that Regulation also specifies that for existing products within the meaning of Article 10(1), an application shall be submitted in accordance with Article 7, at the latest one year before the expiry date of the authorisation given pursuant to Directive 70/524/EEC for additives with a limited authorisation period, and within a maximum of 7 years after the entry into force of this Regulation for additives authorised without a time limit or pursuant to Directive 82/471/EEC.The European Commission received a request from the company CAIMA ‐ Indústria de Celulose, S.A.2 for authorisation of the product lignosulphonate of magnesium to be used as a feed additive (category: technological additives; functional group: binders) for all animal species.According to Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, the Commission forwarded the application to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) as an application under Article 10(2) (re‐evaluation of an authorised feed additive). EFSA received directly from the applicant the technical dossier in support of this application3. The particulars and documents in support of the application were considered valid by EFSA as of 13 December 2019.According to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, EFSA, after verifying the particulars and documents submitted by the applicant, shall undertake an assessment in order to determine whether the feed additive complies with the conditions laid down in Article 5. EFSA shall deliver an opinion on the safety for the target animals, consumer, user and the environment and on the efficacy of the product lignosulphonate of magnesium, for all animal species and categories.The present application concerns the product lignosulphonate of magnesium to be used as a technological additive (functional group: binders) in feed for all animal species.The European Commission received an application for the use of this product in feed for all animal species on 8 March 2010. This application was received by EFSA on 23 June 2014. EFSA immediately started the verification of the dossier to check whether all the documents and particulars requested in Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 were provided. A substantial amount of information was identified as missing in the technical dossier which would prevent EFSA to start its assessment. A missing information request was sent to the applicant on 1 August 2014 and covered the format requirements of the application and the sections and files of the dossier. In two occasions the applicant requested extensions of the deadline to provide the information, which was eventually set to 31 December 2015 in agreement with the FEED Unit. The applicant indicated its intention to withdraw the application to EFSA (12 January 2016) but has never sent an official request. EFSA requested further clarifications on the status of this request on 5 April 2019. In the absence of a reply, EFSA notified the applicant on 13 December 2019 on its intention to finalise the assessment regarding the dossier of reference with the information available. In the absence of adequate information, the FEEDAP Panel is not in a position to characterise the additive and to assess its safety and efficacy.EFSA has verified the European Union Reference Laboratory (EURL) report as it relates to the methods used for the control of the lignosulphonate of magnesium in animal feed.

        "full-text": "Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of Nimicoat® (carvacrol), as a zootechnical additive for weaned piglets. The assessment was performed based on the principles of Regulation (EC) No 429/2008 and the applicable Guidance of the FEEDAP Panel.The additive Nimicoat® is composed of the active substance carvacrol (40 %) encapsulated with high‐melting lipids; other components of the additive are amorphous silica and a surfactant. It is intended to be used as a zootechnical additive (functional group: other zootechnical additives) to enhance the growth in weaned piglets, at a minimum recommended dose of 250 mg/kg complete feed and at a maximum recommended dose of 1,000 mg/kg complete feed corresponding to a minimum and maximum of 100 and 400 mg carvacrol/kg complete feed.Nimicoat® is considered safe for weaned piglets at a maximum content of 1,000 mg/kg complete feed (corresponding to 400 mg carvacrol/kg complete feed). However, owing to the uncertainties derived from necropsy data (only one gender examined, organ weight not reported), a precise figure for the margin of safety cannot be defined.Carvacrol was shown to be not genotoxic. The available studies indicate that any carvacrol residue in edible tissues would be below the measurable levels, when the additive is used at the maximum intended dose. Consequently, and considering that carvacrol is authorised for food, the FEEDAP Panel concluded that the use of the additive in animal nutrition is considered safe for consumers of animal products under the proposed conditions of use.Based on studies on eyes and skin and on the respiratory system, the FEEDAP Panel concluded that the additive is corrosive to eyes, skin and the respiratory mucosae.Concerning safety for the environment, the Phase I calculations of the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) in soil and groundwater showed that the values of the worst‐case estimation were above the thresholds; therefore, a Phase II was required. Taking into consideration the physico‐chemical properties of the additive, its fate and behaviour, the PECs, the ecotoxicity studies, the estimated risk characterisation for the terrestrial and aquatic species, the bioaccumulation potential and the risk for secondary poisoning, the FEEDAP Panel concluded that (i) the additive does not pose any risk to the terrestrial and to the aquatic compartment, and (ii) bioaccumulation potential for carvacrol is low and risk for secondary poisoning for worm/fish eating birds and mammals is not likely to occur.Four efficacy studies were provided by the applicant to support the efficacy of the additive, from which only two were considered. Only in one of these studies, piglets’ zootechnical performance was significantly improved with diets supplemented with Nimicoat® at the minimum recommended level of 250 mg/kg complete feed. Owing that three studies to positively support efficacy of the additive are needed, and only one was available, the FEEDAP Panel is not in a position to conclude on the efficacy of Nimicoat®.The FEEDAP Panel further notes that the data provided do not support the proposal of the applicant to add Nimicoat® to compound feed at the maximum of 1,000 mg/kg of feedingstuffs during the first weeks after weaning to a maximum of 3 weeks, and at the minimum of 250 mg/kg thereafter for a minimum of 4 weeks.The additive Nimicoat® is composed of carvacrol as the active substance, encapsulated with high‐melting lipids. It is intended to be used as a zootechnical additive (functional group: other zootechnical additives) to enhance the growth in piglets.The FEEDAP Panel concludes that the use of Nimicoat® in feed for weaned piglets at the maximum recommended dose of 1,000 mg/kg complete feed (corresponding to 400 mg carvacrol/kg complete feed) is safe for the target animals.

        "summary": "The 2011 EFSA opinion on   was updated using more recent scientific data. The relative risk reduction in EU human campylobacteriosis attributable to broiler meat was estimated for on‐farm control options using Population Attributable Fractions (PAF) for interventions that reduce   flock prevalence, updating the modelling approach for interventions that reduce caecal concentrations and reviewing scientific literature. According to the PAF analyses calculated for six control options, the mean relative risk reductions that could be achieved by adoption of each of these six control options individually are estimated to be substantial but the width of the confidence intervals of all control options indicates a high degree of uncertainty in the specific risk reduction potentials. The updated model resulted in lower estimates of impact than the model used in the previous opinion. A 3‐log  reduction in broiler caecal concentrations was estimated to reduce the relative EU risk of human campylobacteriosis attributable to broiler meat by 58% compared to an estimate larger than 90% in the previous opinion. Expert Knowledge Elicitation was used to rank control options, for weighting and integrating different evidence streams and assess uncertainties. Medians of the relative risk reductions of selected control options had largely overlapping probability intervals, so the rank order was uncertain: vaccination 27% (90% probability interval (PI) 4–74%); feed and water additives 24% (90% PI 4–60%); discontinued thinning 18% (90% PI 5–65%); employing few and well‐trained staff 16% (90% PI 5–45%); avoiding drinkers that allow standing water 15% (90% PI 4–53%); addition of disinfectants to drinking water 14% (90% PI 3–36%); hygienic anterooms 12% (90% PI 3–50%); designated tools per broiler house 7% (90% PI 1–18%). It is not possible to quantify the effects of combined control activities because the evidence‐derived estimates are inter‐dependent and there is a high level of uncertainty associated with each.",
        "full-text": "In 2011, EFSA published an opinion on ‘Campylobacter in broiler meat production: Control options and performance objectives and/or targets at different stages of the food chain’. In 2018, the European Commission requested the Panel on Biological Hazards to deliver a scientific opinion updating and reviewing control options for Campylobacter in broilers, focussing on primary production. In particular, the Panel was requested to review, identify and rank the possible control options at the primary production level, considering and, if possible, quantifying the expected efficiency in reducing human campylobacteriosis cases. Advantages and disadvantages of different options at primary production should be assessed, as well as the possible synergic effect of combined control options.The update of the previous opinion was carried out by reviewing the scientific literature published since then and by estimating the relative risk reduction, expressed as the percentage reduction in human campylobacteriosis in the EU associated with the consumption of broiler meat that could be achieved by implementing control options at primary production of broilers. The relative risk was estimated for on‐farm control options using population attributable fractions (PAF) for interventions that reduce Campylobacter flock prevalence, updating the modelling approach for interventions that reduce caecal concentrations and reviewing the scientific literature. The effect of control options that reduce the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in broilers was estimated by calculating PAF, derived from epidemiological risk factors studies, and assuming a proportionate relation between flock prevalence prior to slaughter and the associated public health risk. The effect of control options that reduce Campylobacter spp. concentration in broilers was estimated by using a regression model, associating concentrations in the caeca and on skin samples, combined with a consumer phase and a dose response model. For some control options, the relative risk reduction could not be calculated by these methods and their effect was estimated using evidence from the scientific literature.The PAF were calculated for six control options from several studies and included hygienic anteroom; effective rodent control; having no animals in close proximity to the broiler house; addition of disinfectant to drinking water; employing few and well‐trained staff and avoiding drinkers that allow standing water. The variation was greater between the different control options than for the same control options in different studies, which increased the confidence in the extrapolation potential of the results to the European Union (EU).According to the PAF analyses, the mean relative risk reductions that could be achieved by adoption of each of these six control options individually are estimated to be substantial but the width of the confidence intervals of all control options indicates a high degree of uncertainty in the specific risk reduction potentials. For example, the mean estimate of the relative risk reduction for the control option ‘Addition of disinfectants to drinking water’ was between 5 (95% CI 0.6–8.2) and 32% (95% CI 6.0–54.9) based on three available studies.The modelling approach for relative risk reductions achieved by a reduction of Campylobacter concentrations in the caeca, previously used in the 2011 opinion, was updated. A wider variety of consumer phase models and a newly published dose response model were also included. Furthermore, newly and more extensive published data on the relationship between Campylobacter concentrations in the caeca and corresponding broiler carcass skin samples were used. The updated model resulted in lower estimates of the slope of the linear regression line describing the relation between concentrations in caecal contents and on skin. As a result of the decrease of this slope, lower estimates were obtained for the effectiveness of control options directed at a reduction in the caecal concentrations. For example, for a 2‐log10 reduction in caecal concentrations, the median estimate was now a relative risk reduction of campylobacteriosis attributable to the consumption of broiler meat produced in the EU of 42% (95% CI 11–75%), whereas in the previous opinion, this relative risk reduction was 76–98% based on data from four Member States (MSs). Similarly, a 3‐log10 reduction in broiler caecal concentrations was estimated to reduce the relative EU risk of human campylobacteriosis attributable to broiler meat by 58% (95% CI 16–89%), compared to a relative risk reduction estimate of more than 90% in four MSs, which was found previously.Overall, the ranking of control options was informed by three different evidence streams: effect of control options to reduce flock prevalence (supported by PAF calculations based on literature data), effect of control options to reduce the concentrations in broiler caeca (supported by estimates obtained by a combination of models) and effect of control options directly obtained from literature (not supported by either PAF or modelling). Also, the evidence from regional studies and laboratory experiments had to be translated into EU wide effects in field conditions, and the current application of control measures, as well as the modelling assumptions, had to be taken into account when assessing the effectiveness of the control options. Therefore, expert judgement was required for ranking the control options considering the associated uncertainties. The Panel agreed on the use of a structured approach, based on EFSA's (2014) guidance on expert knowledge elicitation (EKE), to ensure that all the identified evidence and uncertainties were considered in a balanced way and to improve the rigour and reliability of the judgements involved.The effectiveness of 20 control options if implemented by all broiler farms in the EU, taking into account the current level of implementation, was estimated using a two‐step EKE process informed by the results from modelling of the updated scientific evidence, literature review (including the previous EFSA opinion) and also the experts’ knowledge and experience. Within the time frame of this opinion, experts made selections through the first step where all the options were considered and for the second step where eight control options were prioritised for further assessment of the magnitude of their effects.In the first step of the EKE, for each of the control options, experts (i.e. working group members and selected EFSA staff) individually estimated the probability that the relative risk reduction would be larger than 10%. This 10% was chosen for its discriminative power in differentiating between the effectiveness of control options. The relative risk reduction was judged to have a higher probability to be larger than 10% for 12 control options: hygienic anterooms at broiler house entrance; no animals in close proximity of the broiler houses; employing few and well‐trained staff; addition of disinfectants to drinking water; avoiding drinkers that allow standing water; effective cleaning and disinfection between flocks; reduced slaughter age; discontinued thinning; designated tools for each broiler house; feed and water additives; bacteriophages and vaccination. The remaining eight control options, which were judged to have a lower probability to give more than 10% relative risk reduction included: effective rodent control; adjusting downtime between flocks; fly screens and keeping insects out of the broiler house; clean or amended litter; stocking density and flock size; the number of houses on site; selective breeding and feed structure.From the 12 selected control options, eight options were selected for risk prioritisation based on the quality of evidence available and practical feasibility in the implementation of the control option.The median values of the relative risk reduction of the eight prioritised control options were judged to be as follows; vaccination 27% (90% probability interval (PI) 4–74%); feed and water additives 24% (90% PI 4–60%); discontinued thinning 18% (90% PI 5–65%); employing few and well‐trained staff 16% (90% PI 5–45%); avoiding drinkers that allow standing water 15% (90% PI 4–53%); addition of disinfectants to drinking water 14% (90% PI 3–36%); hygienic anterooms at broiler house entrance 12% (90% PI 3–50%); designated tools per broiler house 7% (90% PI 1–18%). It was not possible to rank the selected control options according to effectiveness based on the EKE judgements because there is a substantial overlap of the probability intervals, due to the large uncertainties involved.There are advantages and disadvantages associated with each control option. The advantages include ease of application (e.g. hygiene barrier, adding additives to feed), improved bird health (e.g. biosecurity actions), better broiler welfare (e.g. discontinued thinning), cross‐protection against other pathogens (e.g. drinking water treatments, feed additives). The disadvantages for a given control option may include a requirement for investment (e.g. if structural changes are required to install an anteroom), lack of control (e.g. the farmer may not own the fields adjacent to the broiler house and therefore cannot prevent other animals being close by), reduced broiler growth due to decreased consumption of feed and/or water (e.g. if an additive affected the sensory (odour, taste or appearance) properties making the feed or water less palatable).Multiple control activities are expected to have a higher effect preventing Campylobacter spp. from entering the broiler house and infecting the birds. To minimise the risk of Campylobacter colonisation, all control activities relating to biosecurity would have to be implemented in full. It is not possible to reliably assess the effect of combined control activities because they are inter‐dependent and there is a high level of uncertainty associated with each. Some control options enhance while others reduce the effect of others. Combining two control measures targeting prevalence and concentration, respectively, may result in an additive effect, if their specific targets are unrelated.To address the different parts of the ToR, the conclusions have been reformulated as answers to the following assessment questions:Assessment question 1: What new scientific evidence about control options has become available since the previous opinion of 2011 and what is their relative risk reduction on campylobacteriosis?\n\nNew information was published since the EFSA 2011 Opinion that provides additional evidence that slaughter age, season, thinning, contaminated drinking water and carry‐over from a previous flock are important risk factors for Campylobacter spp. colonisation of a broiler flock.\nNew epidemiological evidence was analysed by the use of PAFs to obtain estimates of the effectiveness of several control options at primary production that reduce the flock prevalence.\nPAFs were calculated for six control options from available studies including; hygienic anteroom, effective rodent control, having no animals in close proximity to the broiler house, addition of disinfectant to drinking water, employing few and well‐trained staff and avoiding drinkers that allow standing water.\nAccording to the PAF analyses, the mean relative risk reductions that could be achieved by adoption of each of these six control options individually are estimated to be substantial but the width of the confidence intervals of all control options indicates a high degree of uncertainty in the specific risk reduction potentials. For example, the mean estimate of the relative risk reduction for the control option ‘Addition of disinfectants to drinking water’ was between 5 (95% CI 0.6–8.2) and 32% (95% CI 6.0–54.9) based on three available studies.\nIn a review of information available since 2011, new experimental studies were identified that reported estimates of the log reduction in caeca (and variation therein) that may be obtained by providing feed or water additives or through application of vaccination. However, no new information was available from field studies.\nNewly published data on the relationship between Campylobacter spp. concentrations in caecal contents and on skin samples, a larger variety of consumer phase models and a newly published dose response model allowed an update of the modelling approach for interventions that reduce the Campylobacter spp. concentrations in broiler caeca. This led to lower effect estimates than with the model used in the 2011 opinion. For a 2‐log10 reduction in caecal concentrations, the median estimate of relative risk reduction is 42% (95% CI 11–75%), compared to the previous opinion, where this relative risk reduction was 76–98% in four MSs. A 3‐log10 reduction is estimated to reduce the risk in the EU by 58% (95% CI 16–89%), compared to a relative risk reduction larger than 90% in four MS in the previous opinion.\nAssessment question 2: What is the ranking in terms of effectiveness of the selected control options in reducing human campylobacteriosis cases at the primary production level?\n\nThe effectiveness of 20 control options if implemented by all broiler farms in EU, taking into account the current level of implementation, was estimated by means of a two‐step expert knowledge elicitation (EKE) process informed by results from modelling of the updated scientific evidence, literature review (including the 2011 EFSA opinion) and experts’ experience.\nThe following eight control options were judged to have lower probability of achieving a reduction of at least 10% in the incidence of campylobacteriosis: effective rodent control, downtime between flocks, fly screens and keeping insects out of the broiler house, clean or amended litter, stocking density and flock size, the number of houses on site, selective breeding and feed structure.\nThe other 12 control options were judged as having a higher probability of achieving a reduction of at least 10% in the incidence of campylobacteriosis: hygienic anterooms at broiler house entrance, no animals in close proximity of the broiler houses, employing few and well‐trained staff, addition of disinfectants to drinking water, avoiding drinkers that allow standing water, effective cleaning and disinfection, reduced slaughter age, discontinued thinning, designated tools per broiler house, feed and water additives, bacteriophages and vaccination.\nFrom the 12 selected control options, eight options were selected for further evaluation based on the quality of evidence available and practical feasibility in the implementation of the control option.\nThe median relative risk reduction for those eight control options was judged in the EKE process to be as follows; vaccination 27% (90% Probability interval (PI) 4–74%); feed and water additives 24% (90% PI 4–60%); discontinued thinning 18% (90% PI 5–65%); employing few and well‐trained staff 16% (90% PI 5–45%); avoiding drinkers that allow standing water 15% (90% PI 4–53%); addition of disinfectants to drinking water 14% (90% PI 3–36%); hygienic anterooms at broiler house entrance 12% (90% PI 3–50%); designated tools per broiler house 7% (90% PI 1–18%).\nIt was not possible to rank the selected control options according to their effectiveness based on the EKE judgements because there was a large overlap between the probability intervals, due to the large uncertainties involved.\nAssessment question 3: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the selected control options?\n\nThe advantages include ease of application for some measures (e.g. hygiene barrier, adding additives to feed), improved bird health (e.g. biosecurity actions), better broiler welfare (e.g. discontinued thinning) or cross‐protection against other pathogens (e.g. drinking water treatments, feed additives).\nThe disadvantages for a given control option may include a requirement for investment (e.g. if structural changes are required to install an anteroom), lack of control (e.g. the farmer may not own the fields adjacent to the broiler house and therefore cannot prevent other animals being close by) or reduced broiler growth due to decreased consumption of feed and/or water (e.g. if an additive affected the sensory (odour, taste or appearance) properties making the feed or water unpalatable).\nAssessment question 4: What would be the effect of combining control options?\n\nMultiple control activities are expected to have a higher effect preventing Campylobacter spp. from entering the broiler house and infecting the birds. To minimise the risk of Campylobacter colonisation, all control activities relating to biosecurity would have to be implemented in full.\nIt is not possible to quantify the effects of combined control activities because the evidence‐derived estimates are inter‐dependent and there is a high level of uncertainty associated with each. Some control options enhance the effect of others and some could reduce the effect of other control options.\nCombining two control options targeting prevalence and concentration, respectively, may result in a cumulative effect, if their targets are unrelated.\n\n\n\nIt is recommended to collect new data (new baseline study) for an update of the current Campylobacter spp. prevalence in the EU, including the quantification of Campylobacter spp. in caeca and on carcass skin samples of the same flocks, for a better estimation of the correlation between Campylobacter concentrations at caeca and carcases.\n\nMore field studies of sufficient scale and consistency to provide definitive findings at EU level should be encouraged, especially on the effect of vaccination, probiotics, water and feed additives and pre‐slaughter phage treatment on Campylobacter spp. in broilers because of the large uncertainty related to the extrapolation from experimental studies. Moreover, field studies should also be undertaken on different combinations of control options.\n\nIt is recommended to extend this update of the 2011 opinion to include control options throughout the whole broiler chain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABC\n\nATP‐binding cassettes\n\n\n\n\nAQ\n\nAssessment question\n\n\n\n\nCFU\n\nColony‐forming units\n\n\n\n\nCI\n\nConfidence Interval\n\n\n\n\nCPM\n\nConsumer Phase model\n\n\n\n\nDR\n\nDose response\n\n\n\n\nEKE\n\nExpert Knowledge Elicitation\n\n\n\n\nFA\n\nFeed Additive\n\n\n\n\nFCI\n\nFood chain intervention\n\n\n\n\nFP\n\nFlock Prevalence\n\n\n\n\nInc\n\nIncidence\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nMember State\n\n\n\n\nNP\n\nNanoparticle\n\n\n\n\nOMP\n\nOuter membrane proteins\n\n\n\n\nOR\n\nOdds ratio\n\n\n\n\nPAF\n\nPopulation attributable fractions\n\n\n\n\nPHC\n\nProcess Hygiene Criterion\n\n\n\n\nPI\n\nProbability Interval\n\n\n\n\nQMRA\n\nQuantitative microbiological risk assessment\n\n\n\n\nRR\n\nRisk Reduction\n\n\n\n\nRRR\n\nRelative risk reduction\n\n\n\n\nSD\n\nStandard Deviation\n\n\n\n\nSE\n\nStandard Error\n\n\n\n\nS.E.M.\n\nStandard error of the mean\n\n\n\n\nSPF\n\nSpecific pathogen free\n\n\n\n\nToR\n\nTerms of Reference\n\n\n\n\nVA\n\nVaccine\n\n\n\n\nWG\n\nWorking Group\n\n\n"

        "summary": "Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed ( ) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of GalliPro  Fit (  32324,   32325 and   25840) when used as a zootechnical additive in feed and water for drinking for all poultry species for fattening or reared for laying/breeding. The two bacterial species present in the additive are considered suitable for the qualified presumption of safety ( ) approach to safety assessment. The identity of the active agents was established and the lack of toxigenic potential confirmed. The strains did not show resistance to relevant antibiotics. Therefore, the additive was presumed safe for the target species, consumers and the environment. In the absence of data, no conclusions could be drawn on the skin/eye irritancy or skin sensitisation of the additive. Due to the proteinaceous nature of the active agents, the additive was considered a respiratory sensitiser.

However, the data provided did not allow to conclude on the compatibility of the additive with other coccidiostats.

        "full-text": "GalliPro® Fit (B. subtilis DSM 32324, B. subtilis DSM 32325 and B. amyloliquefaciens DSM 25840) is intended to be used as a zootechnical additive (functional group: gut flora stabiliser) in feed and water for drinking for chickens for fattening, chickens reared for laying, turkeys for fattening, turkeys reared for breeding and other minor growing poultry species.The three active agents included in the additive (B. subtilis DSM 32324, B. subtilis DSM 32325 and B. amyloliquefaciens DSM 25840) meet the requirements of the QPS approach to safety assessment and are presumed safe for the target animals, consumers of products derived from animals fed the additive and the environment. Since the other components of the additive do not give rise to concerns, GalliPro® Fit is also considered safe for the target species, consumer and the environment.In the absence of data, no conclusions on the skin/eye irritancy or skin sensitisation of the additive can be made. Due to the proteinaceous nature of the active agents, the additive should be considered a respiratory sensitiser.GalliPro® Fit has a potential to be efficacious as a zootechnical additive in chickens for fattening at 1.6 × 109 CFU/kg feed and at 5.4 × 108 CFU/L water for drinking. This conclusion is extended to chickens reared for laying or breeding and is extrapolated to turkeys for fattening, turkeys reared for breeding and minor growing poultry species.

The food enzyme is free from viable cells of the production organism. The food enzyme is intended to be used in sugar production and processing. As residual amounts of total organic solids ( ) are removed during the production of refined sugars, dietary exposure was calculated only for unrefined sugar products. Based on the maximum use levels, dietary exposure to the food enzyme   was estimated to be up to 15 μg  /kg body weight (bw) per day in European populations. Genotoxicity tests did not raise a safety concern. The systemic toxicity was assessed by means of a repeated dose 90‐day oral toxicity study in rats. The Panel identified a no observed adverse effect level ( ) of 110 mg  /kg bw per day, the highest dose tested, which, when compared with the estimated dietary exposure, results in a sufficiently high margin of exposure (MoE) of at least 7,300. Similarity of the amino acid sequence of the food enzyme to those of known allergens was searched and no match was found. The Panel considered that, under the intended conditions of use, the risk of allergic sensitisation and elicitation reactions by dietary exposure cannot be excluded, but the likelihood is considered to be low. Based on the data provided, the Panel concluded that this food enzyme does not give rise to safety concerns under the intended conditions of use.",
        "full-text": "Article 3 of the Regulation (EC) No 1332/20081 provides definition for ‘food enzyme’ and ‘food enzyme preparation’.‘Food enzyme’ means a product obtained from plants, animals or micro‐organisms or products thereof including a product obtained by a fermentation process using micro‐organisms: (i) containing one or more enzymes capable of catalysing a specific biochemical reaction; and (ii) added to food for a technological purpose at any stage of the manufacturing, processing, preparation, treatment, packaging, transport or storage of foods.‘Food enzyme preparation’ means a formulation consisting of one or more food enzymes in which substances such as food additives and/or other food ingredients are incorporated to facilitate their storage, sale, standardisation, dilution or dissolution.Before January 2009, food enzymes other than those used as food additives were not regulated or were regulated as processing aids under the legislation of the Member States. On 20 January 2009, Regulation (EC) No 1332/2008 on food enzymes came into force. This Regulation applies to enzymes that are added to food to perform a technological function in the manufacture, processing, preparation, treatment, packaging, transport or storage of such food, including enzymes used as processing aids. Regulation (EC) No 1331/20082 established the European Union (EU) procedures for the safety assessment and the authorisation procedure of food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings. The use of a food enzyme shall be authorised only if it is demonstrated that:\n\nit does not pose a safety concern to the health of the consumer at the level of use proposed;\nthere is a reasonable technological need;\nits use does not mislead the consumer.\nAll food enzymes currently on the European Union market and intended to remain on that market, as well as all new food enzymes, shall be subjected to a safety evaluation by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and approval via an EU Community list.The ‘Guidance on submission of a dossier on food enzymes for safety evaluation’ (EFSA, 2009a) lays down the administrative, technical and toxicological data required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIUBMB nomenclature\nDextranase\n\n\nSystematic name\n6‐α‐d‐glucan 6‐glucanohydrolase\n\n\nSynonyms\ndextran hydrolase, dextranase DL 2, endodextranase\n\n\nIUBMB no\nEC 3.2.1.11\n\n\nCAS no\n9025‐70‐1\n\n\nEINECS no\n232‐803‐9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDextranase catalyses the hydrolysis of 1,6 α‐d glucosidic linkages in dextran.

        "summary": "The Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed ( ) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the application for renewal of authorisation of zinc chelate of hydroxy analogue of methionine (Mintrex Zn) for all animal species. The   Panel has delivered three opinions (during 2008 and 2009) on the safety and efficacy of the additive. The additive was authorised in 2010 as ‘Zinc chelate of hydroxy analogue of methionine’ containing 17.5−18 % zinc, 81 % (2‐hydroxy‐4‐methylthio)butanoic acid ( ‐methionine hydroxy analogue,  a) and maximum 1% mineral oil. Following some modifications in the manufacturing process, the additive does not contain mineral oil and the applicant proposes the following specifications: ≥ 17 % zinc and ≥ 79 %  a. The data provided indicate that the additive complies with the new specifications. No new evidence was found that would make the   Panel reconsidering its previous conclusions on the safety for target species, consumers and environment. The applicant provided new studies on the effects of the additive on the respiratory tract and on skin and eyes. Data on the characterisation of the additive and the new studies on skin/eyes led the Panel to reconsider the safety for the user. Owing to the zinc and nickel content of Mintrex Zn, the handling of the additive poses a risk to users by inhalation; the additive is not a skin or eye irritant but is considered a skin sensitiser. The present application did not include a proposal for amending or supplementing the conditions of the original authorisation that would have an impact on the efficacy of the additive; therefore, there was no need for assessing the efficacy of the additive in the context of the renewal of the authorisation.",

        "full-text": "In the current situation, the import of oak logs with bark from US involves actions taken at the country of origin and at destination. The derogation only regulates some aspects related to the trade of the commodity, while part of the actions taken in the US before shipment and part of the actions taken in the EU after arrival are common practice, but not explicitly regulated.In this section, a description of the different actions, regulated and non‐regulated, is provided, assessing effectiveness and uncertainty specific to each RRO.The risk associated with the importation into the EU of oak logs with bark from US in relation to the presence of B. fagacearum under the systems approach proposed by USDA APHIS with logs fumigated with SF was assessed and compared with the current system (regulated under Commission Decision 2005/359/EC), which includes either fumigation of logs with MB or, for white oaks exported in certain periods of the year and to certain regions of the EU, non‐fumigation. The risk was assessed in a quantitative manner, using expert judgement, until the point of entry into the EU whereas a non‐quantitative assessment was conducted for all the subsequent steps until the mills in the EU.The quantitative assessment until the point of entry in the EU and the supporting evidence suggest that none of the systems is fully effective in preventing the introduction of B. fagacearum:\n\nThe likelihood of pest freedom of containers at the point of entry in the EU under the systems approach proposed by USDA APHIS with logs fumigated with SF was estimated as ‘very frequently pest free’ with the 90% uncertainty range spanning from ‘more often than not pest free’ to ‘pest free with some exceptional cases’. The Expert Knowledge Elicitation indicated, with 95% certainty, that between 8,639 and 10,000 containers per 10,000 would be free from B. fagacearum.\nThe likelihood of pest freedom at the point of entry in the EU under the current system with fumigation of logs with MB was estimated as ‘very frequently pest free’ with the 90% uncertainty range spanning from ‘very frequently pest free’ to ‘pest free with some exceptional cases’. The Expert Knowledge Elicitation indicated, with 95% certainty, that between 9,573 and 10,000 containers per 10,000 would be free from B. fagacearum.\nThe likelihood of pest freedom at the point of entry in the EU under the current system without fumigation of white oak logs was estimated as ‘frequently pest free’ with the 90% uncertainty range spanning from ‘more often than not pest free’ to ‘very frequently pest free’. The Expert Knowledge Elicitation indicated, with 95% certainty, that between 7,803 and 10,000 containers per 10,000 would be free from B. fagacearum.\nThe results of the quantitative assessment until the point of entry in the EU indicate that the most effective import option was the current import option using MB, followed by the systems approach proposed by USDA APHIS with oak logs fumigated with SF. The least effective import option was the systems approach based on delivering white oak logs in certain periods of the year to certain regions of the EU without fumigation.The risk of entry of B. fagacearum into the EU does not necessarily correspond to the likelihood of establishment of the pest in the EU, due to several reasons:\n\nAfter entry, a series of RROs is regulated in the EU under current derogation and contributes to reduce the risk of transfer of the pathogen to a suitable host. This holds for all the import options assessed. Notably, the import option on white oak without fumigation, compared with the two other import options assessed in the opinion, is subject to more stringent measures in the EU (listed under Art. 8 of Commission Decision 2005/359/EC), which will make the risk associated with this import option closer to import options with fumigation.\nB. fagacearum needs suitable environmental conditions and the presence of suitable hosts for establishment to occur in the EU.\nEfficient insect vectors, either native to the EU territory or imported from North America, are also essential for establishment. Several consignments of oak logs with bark from US were intercepted because either infested by insects or not properly fumigated suggesting that an entry of infested logs with insect vectors from US may happen.\nIn conclusion, the weakest point in the systems approach proposed in the Dossier up to the point of entry in the EU is the performance of SF on oak logs with bark compared to MB.Other critical aspects common to the three system approaches assessed in the opinion have been identified:\n\nMost of RROs conducted in the US and that could reduce the risk of importing infested logs to EU are performed on a voluntary basis or they are regulated only in some states and in some circumstances; in particular: certification of forest stands, periods of marking and cutting of trees, communication of the presence of oak wilt symptoms to the phytosanitary services, removal of diseased trees.\nCurrent detection procedures hinging on isolations of the fungus from small branches (EPPO, 2001) are not applicable for inspections of logs before export and import.\nEU inspections of US oak logs do not require sampling and laboratory testing in the absence of symptoms.\nThe transport in closed containers from US to the mill is not compulsory.\nCooking of logs before processing does not apply to products other than veneer.\nThe way residues are destroyed is not specified in Commission Decision 2005/359/EC.\nAn increase in the likelihood of pest freedom for B. fagacearum of oak logs with bark from US is expected, should the indicated measures in the US be regulated in all states. RROs proposed to be undertaken in the EU are expected to further reduce the risk of establishment of B. fagacearum, should these RROs be regulated, correctly implemented and checked by the NPPOs.Oak logs with bark are a commodity that currently involves a limited number of MSs and 28 thousand CBM, which represents a small proportion of the total volume of oak wood traded from the US (2% of the total volume imported during the last 3 years). B. fagacearum has been reported as viable in sawn lumber up to 24 weeks after sawing (Tainter et al., 1984). Given these reasons, the assessment of the potential risk of entry of B. fagacearum with oak lumber from US is worth being investigated.Given the results of the quantitative assessment, the import of non‐fumigated white oak logs with the restrictions listed under Art 8. seems to pose a high risk. That conclusion would require further quantitative assessment on the risk of establishment and efficacy of RROs in the EU. This pathway also raises concerns about potential introduction of other pests associated with this commodity.This opinion allowed the identification of a series of actions, in the US and in the EU that are effective in reducing the level of risk but are currently not regulated (Section 6.1.1 Table 6, Section 6.2 Table 8). A pathway analysis may help to identify the most effective ones, provided a thorough data collection from MSs and private sector (EU sawmills) is implemented. For instance, the transport of logs in closed shipping containers up to the arrival at the mill is crucial in limiting the spread of any pest from the commodity and is currently commonly applied but not regulated. Alternatively, containers could be opened for inspections in the port entry far away from suitable hosts.Conversely, critical steps could involve actions already regulated and their identification would better target disease control. For instance, if the wet storage of logs under a sprinkler system fails or is not correctly applied, the likelihood of establishment of the pest may even increase as a result of fungal mat development and uptake of inoculum of the pathogen by potential native insect vectors.Therefore, should the derogation be renewed by incorporating the proposals of USDA APHIS, the Panel would like to stress:\n\nthe importance of developing technical solutions for a fumigation reaction test for SF;\na study on the effectiveness of SF against B. fagacearum under commercial conditions (e.g. logs with bark up to 90 cm diameter) to reduce the uncertainty on its efficacy;\nthe need for standardised inspection, sampling and detection procedures in line with ISPM 31 (FAO, 2016), including LAMP assays or other molecular tools already available (Yang and Juzwik, 2017), to be used during inspections for export and import even in the absence of symptoms;\nthe opportunity to revisit whether some of the measures listed in Art. 8 of the Derogation (i.e. seasonality and latitude as from conditions (c) and (e)) are still relevant under the current climate change scenario and the fact that other potential vectors in the EU can play a role in the establishment of B. fagacearum (e.g. nitidulid beetles).\nFinally, the literature review (Appendix A) and the hearing with USDA APHIS (EFSA, online) allowed the identification of alternative treatments (e.g. vacuum steam treatment and EDN), which could represent promising alternatives able to further reduce the level of risk related to the import of oak logs with bark even compared with MB. However, technical hurdles need to be taken before these alternative treatments can be implemented (EFSA, online).A systems approach to mitigate the introduction of oak wilt fungus (Bretziella fagacearum) in oak logs (Quercus species) with Bark Exported from the United States to the EU.

Raptors have also been detected infected, particularly common buzzard. The majority of the birds had been found dead or moribund,however, there are also reports ofHPAI virus infection in apparently healthy ducks or geese.A total of 43 HPAI outbreaks were notified in poultry;with signs of avian influenza infection being observed in at least 33 outbreaks;the most likely source of infection was indirect contact with wild birds. Three HPAI virus subtypes, A(H5N8) (n=518), A(H5N5) (n=17) and A(H5N1) (n=6),and four different genotypes were identified, suggesting the occurrence of multiple virus introductions into Europe.The reassortant A(H5N1) virus identified in EU/EEA countries has acquired gene segments from low pathogenic viruses and is not related to A(H5N1) viruses of e.g. clade 2.3.2.1c causing human infections outside of Europe. As the autumn migration of wild waterbirds to their wintering areasin Europe continues, and given the expected local movements of these birds, there is still a high risk of introduction andfurther spread ofHPAI A(H5) viruses within Europe.The risk of virus spread from wild birds to poultry is high and Member States should enforce in ‘high risk areas’ of their territories the measures provided for in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/1136.Detection of outbreaks in breeder farms in Denmark, the Netherlands and United Kingdom, highlight also the risk of introduction via contaminated materials (bedding/straw) and equipment.Maintaining high and sustainable surveillance andbiosecurityparticularly in high‐risk areas is of utmost importance.

With the existing specifications, the food additive must be comprised of not less than 95% of the 11 named steviol glycosides. The proposed change is to include all 60 steviol glycosides in the same limit value of 95% and this would allow the presence of up to 5% of impurities.

However, the Panel cannot conclude on the safety of the proposed amendment to the specifications of steviol glycosides (E 960) as food additive if the purity assay value of not less than 95% for the total content of steviol glycosides is maintained.",
        "full-text": "Following a request from the European Commission to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the Panel on Food Additives and Flavourings (FAF) was asked to provide a scientific opinion on the safety of a proposed amendment of the specifications of the food additive steviol glycosides (E 960), in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings.The present evaluation is based on the data on steviol glycosides in a newly submitted dossier by the applicant and additional information submitted by the applicant during the assessment process in response to a request by EFSA.The safety of steviol glycosides as a food additive was evaluated by EFSA in 2010 and an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 4 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day, expressed as steviol equivalents. Following a subsequent EFSA assessment in 2015 (EFSA ANS Panel, 2015a), rebaudioside D and M were included in the specifications for steviol glycosides (E 960).The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) established an ADI for steviol glycosides of 4 mg/kg bw per day, expressed as steviol (JECFA, 2009). At the JECFA meeting in 2019, a framework was adopted for developing specifications for steviol glycosides by four different methods of production (JECFA, 2020). Specifications for steviol glycosides from Stevia Rebaudiana Bertoni obtained by water extraction were prepared (JECFA, 2020).The applicant asked to amend the existing EU specifications for steviol glycosides to allow for the inclusion of 60 steviol glycosides identified in S. rebaudiana Bertoni leaves, including both ‘major’ and ‘minor’ steviol glycosides, that may comprise the assay value of not less than 95% total steviol glycosides (Appendix A). With the existing specifications, the food additive must be comprised of not less than 95% of the 11 named steviol glycosides. The proposed change is to include all 60 steviol glycosides in the same limit value of 95% and this would allow the presence of up to 5% of impurities. Panel noted that this proposal would allow to have commercial products of lower purity than is currently the case.Data on ADME of some of steviol glycosides currently listed in the EU specifications have been considered and summarised in previous EFSA opinions (EFSA ANS Panel, 2010, 2015a). Based on the available data set, stevioside and Rebaudioside A are not hydrolysed by digestive enzymes of the upper gastrointestinal tract due to the presence of β‐glycosidic bonds, but subject to microbial metabolism in the colon resulting in the release of the aglycone steviol which is then absorbed. In rats and humans, steviol is further glucuronidated; steviol glucuronide is excreted with urine and faeces.Two unpublished studies testing major and minor steviol glycosides in human faecal homogenate have been provided by the applicant. Based on the results from unpublished and published studies, the different rebaudiosides analysed share the same metabolic degradation (i.e. deglycosylation) by the gut microbiome in the colon leading to the formation of steviol. Considering the data set, it can be predicted that all 60 steviol glycosides considered in Appendix A follow the same metabolic fate in the colon with an hydrolysation to steviol.The Panel agreed that the overall metabolic fate of the steviol glycosides listed in Appendix A is the same; therefore, it would be acceptable to use a read across approach taking the toxicological data previously evaluated by EFSA, for the safety assessment of the 60 steviol glycosides and the ADI of 4 mg/kg bw per day will apply to all those steviol glycosides.Regarding the genotoxicity, none of the submitted studies are considered adequate to assess the genotoxic potential of the steviol glycosides preparations to be used as a food additive.As part of the application dossier, the applicant has provided two published studies investigating the effect of dietary administration of rebaudioside A and S. rebaudiana extract on reproductive organs. Overall, in a study on ovarian function in rats with rebaudioside A, no effects were observed relevant for hazard assessment. In addition, the study on sexual function in diabetic rats with a S. rebaudiana extract cannot be used for hazard assessment.The findings from the submitted genotoxicity studies and studies on reproductive organs and related effects do not change the conclusions reached by the EFSA ANS Panel on genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity when steviol glycosides were evaluated for their authorisation as a food additive (EFSA ANS Panel, 2010). However, it is not possible to conclude if the mixture tested in all the various genotoxicity studies previously evaluated by EFSA, can be considered to be sufficiently representative of other kinds of mixtures that the proposed changes in the specifications would allow.Overall, the Panel considered that read‐across is justified and the list of 60 steviol glycosides listed in Appendix A could provide a basis for an amendment of the specifications for steviol glycosides. However, the proposed change from 11 to 60 specified steviol glycosides, whilst maintaining the assay value of not less than 95%, would allow less pure preparations of the food additive onto the market. According to the proposed change in specifications, there remains a small but not insignificant fraction of the additive that would be undefined and therefore cannot be evaluated by the Panel.The Panel concluded that the inclusion of the 60 steviol glycosides in the proposed specifications for steviol glycoside (E960) would not be of safety concern. However, the Panel cannot conclude on the safety of the proposed amendment to the specifications of steviol glycosides (E 960) as food additive if the purity assay value of not less than 95% for the total content of steviol glycosides is maintained.The present scientific opinion deals with the safety evaluation of a proposed modification of the EU specifications of the already authorised food additive, steviol glycosides (E 960) to expand the list of steviol glycosides to 60 steviol glycosides identified in the leaves of Stevia Rebaudiana Bertoni.The present evaluation is based on the data submitted in the application dossier (‘Documentation provided to EFSA’ No 1) and additional information submitted by the applicant during the assessment process following a request by EFSA (‘Documentation provided to EFSA’ No 2 and Documentation provided to EFSA’ No 3).Following the request for additional data sent by EFSA on 25 November 2019, the applicant requested a clarification teleconference on 06 December 2020, after which the applicant provided additional data on 03 January 2020.This opinion was formulated following the principles described in the EFSA Guidance of the Scientific Committee on transparency with regard to scientific aspects of risk assessment (EFSA Scientific Committee, 2009) and following the relevant existing Guidances from the EFSA Scientific Committee.The Guidance for submission for food additive evaluations in 2012 (EFSA ANS Panel, 2012) was followed for the assessment.The Panel concluded that the inclusion of the 60 steviol glycosides in the proposed specifications for steviol glycoside (E960) would not be of safety concern. However, the Panel cannot conclude on the safety of the proposed amendment to the specifications of steviol glycosides (E 960) as food additive if the purity assay value of not less than 95% for the total content of steviol glycosides is maintained.Taking into account the data submitted in the application dossier, the Panel noted that it is technically possible to manufacture steviol glycosides (E960) with a purity higher than 95% for the total steviol glycosides.\n\n\nDossier “Application for a change in the steviol glycoside specification to expand the list of steviol glycosides in the European Union to all those identified in the leaves of Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni”.

        "summary": "The   Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes and Processing Aids ( ) assessed the safety of the substance (triethanolamine‐perchlorate, sodium salt) dimer,   substance No 1080, intended to be used as a thermal stabiliser at up to 0.15% w/w in rigid poly(vinyl chloride) ( ) for repeated use bottles in contact with water. No thermal degradation of the substance is expected during the manufacture of the   articles. In water, the substance fully dissociates into triethanolamine, sodium (cations) and perchlorate. Therefore, migration would lead to exposure to triethanolamine and perchlorate and not to the substance itself. Specific migration of perchlorate, ethanolamine, diethanolamine and triethanolamine was tested under repeated use conditions covering the requested uses. After the second and third contacts, perchlorate was detected at ca. 0.3 μg/kg food. Ethanolamine, diethanolamine and triethanolamine were not detected in any of the three contacts at an estimated limit of detection of 0.03 mg/kg food. The available   studies on the substance confirmed the lack of concern for genotoxicity, as anticipated by the dissociation of the substance into authorised non‐genotoxic substances. Therefore, the   Panel concluded that the substance is not of safety concern for the consumer if used, under the condition requested by the applicant, as an additive at up to 0.15% w/w in rigid   for repeated use bottles intended for contact with water. Additionally, the migration of triethanolamine and perchlorate should not exceed the specific migration limits ( s) of 50 μg/kg food and 2 μg/kg food, respectively, set in the Regulation ( ) 10/2011. This evaluation also covers acidic foods such as fruit juices that can reasonably be foreseen to be in contact.",
        "full-text": "According to the applicant, the substance ‘di(m‐2,2′,2′′‐nitrilotris(ethanol)‐diperchlorato)dinatrium’, renamed by the Panel ‘triethanolamine‐perchlorate, sodium salt) dimer’ for being listed in the Union list, is intended to be used as a thermal stabiliser at up to 0.15% w/w to manufacture rigid poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC). Final articles are repeated use bottles, e.g. used for sports, and intended only for contact with water.2The substance has not been evaluated by the SCF or EFSA in the past. However, triethanolamine (FCM No 793) and sodium perchlorate (FCM No 822 for perchloric acid salts) that constitute the substance are both authorised to be used in plastics (Regulation (EU) 10/20113). Triethanolamine has a specific migration limit (SML) of 50 μg/kg food expressed as the sum of triethanolamine and its hydrochloride expressed as triethanolamine. Perchloric acid, salts has a SML of 2 μg/kg food (Regulation (EU) 2018/834). The CEP Panel acknowledged that the previous SML for perchloric acid, salts was lowered from 50 to 2 μg/kg food by the European Commission in 2018, applying an allocation factor of 10% (due to other sources of exposure) to the tolerable dietary intake (TDI) of 0.3 μg/kg body weight (bw) per day set for perchlorate by the EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (EFSA CONTAM Panel, 2014).Based on the above‐mentioned data, the CEP Panel concluded that the substance ‘(triethanolamine‐perchlorate, sodium salt) dimer’ is not of safety concern for the consumer if used, under the condition requested by the applicant, as additive at up to 0.15% w/w in rigid PVC for repeated use bottles intended for contact with water. Additionally, the migration of triethanolamine and perchlorate should not exceed the SMLs of 50 μg/kg food and 2 μg/kg food, respectively, set in the Regulation (EU) 10/2011.

The   Panel adopted in 2014 an opinion on the safety and in 2015 on the efficacy of this additive. The additive montmorillonite‐illite (  1g557) is currently authorised for use in feedingstuffs for all animal species as an anticaking agent with a minimum and a maximum content of 20,000 mg/kg. The applicant proposed to use the additive in premixtures and complementary feeds for all animal species and categories at a minimum concentration of 20,000 mg/kg premixture and 10,000 mg/kg complementary feeds. The   Panel considers that the proposed modification (reduction of the inclusion level in feed) would not affect the conclusions reached in the previous assessment as related to the safety for the target species, consumers, users and the environment. Montmorillonite‐illite is efficacious as an anticaking agent in premixtures for all animal species at inclusions levels starting at 20,000 mg/kg premixture and in complementary feeds at inclusions levels starting at 10,000 mg/kg. When the premixtures or complementary feeds are incorporated into complete feed, the concentration of montmorillonite‐illite would range from 50 to 100 mg/kg complete feed for poultry and all other animal species, respectively.

        "full-text": "The additive montmorillonite‐illite is authorised as a technological additive, functional groups ‘anticaking agent’ and ‘binder’, to be used in feedingstuffs for all animal species up to the maximum content of 20,000 mg/kg complete feed.The additive under application is also called ‘Friedland clay’. Friedland clay is typically composed of a number of major constituents: montmorillonite (≥ 35%), illite (≥ 30%), quartz (≤ 20%) and kaolinite (≤ 15%); other minor constituents are calcite, cristobalite, goethite, gypsum, hematite, lepidocrocite, magnetite, plagioclase, pyrite, rutile, siderite and tridymite. The additive was fully characterised in the previous opinion on the use of montmorillonite‐illite as technological additive for all animal species (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 2014). No modifications in the manufacturing process or composition of the additive have occurred since the previous assessment. Thus, the data pertaining to composition, impurities, physical properties and shelf‐life still apply. In the same opinion, and a following one, the FEEDAP Panel also assessed the safety and efficacy of montmorillonite‐illite (FIMIX 1g557) in previous opinions (EFSA FEEDAP Panel 2014, 2015). Regarding efficacy, the Panel concluded that the additive is efficacious as pellet binder and anticaking agent.The additive is currently authorised for use in feedingstuffs for all animal species as an anticaking with a minimum and a maximum content of 20,000 mg/kg. The applicant is now proposing to use the additive in premixtures and complementary feedingstuffs for all animal species and categories at a minimum concentration of 20,000 mg/kg premixture and 10,000 mg/kg complementary feeds. This will result in a significant reduction of the minimum content in feed.The applicant proposes therefore to reduce the minimum content in complete feed from 20,000 to 50 mg/kg for poultry species and to 100 mg/kg complete feed for all other animal species. This proposal comes from the theoretical inclusion levels of premixtures and complementary feeds with the additive at the maximum proposed use level (5% and 1%, respectively) to complete feeds.The FEEDAP Panel considers that the proposed modification in the conditions of use (use in premixture and subsequent reduction of the inclusion level in feed) would not affect the conclusions reached in the previous assessment as related to the safety for the target species, consumers, users and the environment.Montmorillonite‐illite is efficacious as an anticaking agent in premixtures for all animal species at inclusions levels of 20,000 mg/kg premixture and in complementary feeds for all animal species at inclusions levels of 10,000 mg/kg complementary feed.

The current scientific opinion covers all plant health risks posed by dormant bare rooted plants for planting of   (1–2 years old) imported from Serbia, considering the available scientific information, including the technical information provided by the Plant Protection Directorate from Serbia on 27 December 2019. The relevance of an  ‐quarantine pest for this opinion was based on evidence that: (a) the pest is present in Serbia; (b) the pest uses   as a host; (c) one or more life stages of the pest can be associated with the specified commodity.

In a first step, Member States were invited to submit by 15 March 2019 their national Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) in a standardised way, in the format of specific GAP forms, allowing the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS), the Netherlands, to identify the critical GAPs in the format of a specific GAP overview file. Subsequently, Member States were requested to provide residue data supporting the critical GAPs, within a period of 1 month, by 10 May 2019. On the basis of all the data submitted by Member States, EFSA asked the RMS to complete the Pesticide Residues Overview File (PROFile) and to prepare a supporting evaluation report, provided by the RMS to EFSA on 22 July 2019. Subsequently, EFSA performed the completeness check of these documents with the RMS. The outcome of this exercise including the clarifications provided by the RMS, if any, was compiled in the completeness check report.Based on the information provided by the RMS, Member States and the EURL, and taking into account the conclusions derived by EFSA in the framework of Commission Regulation (EU) No 188/2011, EFSA prepared in January 2020 a draft reasoned opinion, which was circulated to Member States for consultation via a written procedure. Comments received by 3 March 2020 were considered during the finalisation of this reasoned opinion. The following conclusions are derived.The conclusion of the peer review that Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 is not hazardous to humans remains supported by this review considering new information received on its potential to produce four metabolites that were identified as binase, pumilacidins, cyclo‐(L‐Pro‐L‐Leu) and 3‐formylindole.These metabolites are not considered hazardous for the consumer dietary exposure based on the available body of knowledge in the literature. However, they have not been quantified on the plants and sufficiently validated methods for their quantification are not presented which is considered as desirable.The consumer dietary risk assessment with regard to the use of Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 according to the authorised uses can be finalised based on an expert judgement in this case considering that the metabolites have no identified hazardous properties.Following the assessment according to the criteria defined by the European Commission for inclusion of pesticide active substances into Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, an inclusion of Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 is recommended.Regulation (EC) No 396/20051 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Regulation’) establishes the rules governing the setting and the review of pesticide maximum residue levels (MRLs) at European level. Article 12(1) of that Regulation stipulates that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) shall provide, within 12 months from the date of the inclusion or non‐inclusion of an active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC2 a reasoned opinion on the review of the existing MRLs for that active substance.As Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 was approved on 1 September 2014 by means of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 485/20143 in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107/20094 as amended by Commission Implementing Regulations (EU) No 540/20115 and 541/20116, EFSA initiated the review of all existing MRLs for that active substance.By way of background information, in the framework of Commission Regulation (EU) No 188/20117, Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 was evaluated by The Netherlands, designated as rapporteur Member State (RMS). Subsequently, a peer review on the initial evaluation of the RMS was conducted by EFSA, leading to the conclusions as set out in the EFSA scientific output (EFSA, 2013). Furthermore, according to the provisions of the approval regulation, confirmatory information was requested, in the area of identity of the microorganism, biological properties, physical and technical properties and methods of analysis relevant for residues section to be submitted by 31 August 2016 (EFSA, 2017).According to the legal provisions, EFSA shall base its reasoned opinion in particular on the relevant assessment report prepared under Directive 91/414/EEC repealed by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. It should be noted, however, that, in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, only a few representative uses are evaluated, whereas MRLs set out in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 should accommodate all uses authorised within the European Union (EU), and uses authorised in third countries that have a significant impact on international trade. The information included in the assessment report prepared under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 is therefore insufficient for the assessment of all existing MRLs for a given active substance.To gain an overview of the pesticide residues data that have been considered for the setting of the existing MRLs, EFSA developed the Pesticide Residues Overview File (PROFile). The PROFile is an inventory of all pesticide residues data relevant to the risk assessment and MRL setting for a given active substance. This includes data on:\n\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in primary crops;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in processed commodities;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in rotational crops;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in livestock commodities;\nthe analytical methods for enforcement of the proposed MRLs.\nAs the basis for the MRL review, on 15 February 2019, EFSA initiated the collection of data for this active substance. In a first step, Member States were invited to submit by 15 March 2019 their Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) that are authorised nationally, in a standardised way, in the format of specific GAP forms. In the framework of this consultation, nine Member States provided feedback on their national authorisations of Bacillus pumilus QST 2808. Based on the GAP data submitted, the designated RMS The Netherlands was asked to identify the critical GAPs to be further considered in the assessment, in the format of a specific GAP overview file. Subsequently, in a second step, Member States were requested to provide residue data supporting the critical GAPs by 10 May 2019.On the basis of all the data submitted by Member States, EFSA asked The Netherlands to complete the PROFile and to prepare a supporting evaluation report, submitted to EFSA on 22 July 2019. Subsequently, EFSA performed the completeness check of these documents with the RMS. The outcome of this exercise including the clarifications provided by the RMS, if any, was compiled in the completeness check report.Considering all the available information, EFSA prepared in January 2020 a draft reasoned opinion, which was circulated to Member States for commenting via a written procedure. All comments received by 3 Mach 2020 were considered by EFSA during the finalisation of the reasoned opinion.The evaluation report submitted by the RMS (Netherlands, 2019), taking into account also the information provided by Member States during the collection of data, and that no EURL report on analytical methods was available, are considered as main supporting documents to this reasoned opinion and, thus, made publicly available.In addition, further supporting documents to this reasoned opinion are the completeness check report (EFSA, 2020a) and the Member States consultation report (EFSA, 2020b). These reports are developed to address all issues raised in the course of the review, from the initial completeness check to the reasoned opinion. Furthermore, PROFile and the GAP overview file listing all authorised uses are key supporting documents and made publicly available as background documents to this reasoned opinion.According to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, EFSA shall provide a reasoned opinion on:\n\nthe inclusion of the active substance in Annex IV to the Regulation, when appropriate;\nthe necessity of setting new MRLs for the active substance or deleting/modifying existing MRLs set out in Annex II or III of the Regulation;\nthe inclusion of the recommended MRLs in Annex II or III to the Regulation;\nthe setting of specific processing factors as referred to in Article 20(2) of the Regulation.\nThe general principles for the establishment and update of Annex IV are laid down in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, which requires that for an active substance which shall be included in Annex IV account should be taken of:\n\nthe use of the active substance;\nthe scientific and technical knowledge available;\nthe result of an assessment of any potential risks to consumers with a high intake and high vulnerability and, where appropriate, to animals;\nthe results of any evaluations and decisions to modify the use of plant protection products.\nCriteria for inclusion of active substances into Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 were defined in a guidance document of the European Commission (2015). As outlined in the guidance document, an active substance should comply with one of the following criteria in order to be recommended for inclusion in Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005:\n\nCriterion one: The active substance is approved as a basic substance under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009;\nCriterion two: The compound is listed in Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005;\nCriterion three: The compound has no identified hazardous properties;\nCriterion four: Natural exposure is higher than the one linked to the use of PPP;\nCriterion five: No consumer exposure is forecasted linked to the mode of application of the PPP.\nThe reference isolate of Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 is deposited at the culture collection of the USDA Agricultural Research Service (NRRL) Patent culture collection in Peoria Illinois, USA, under the reference number B‐30087. Bacillus pumilus strain QST 2808 was isolated from a soil sample collected in Pohnpei, Micronesia. Its main metabolites are reported in the assessment section.Uses evaluated comprised field spraying against mildew in grapes as well as field and greenhouse applications against powdery mildew in cucurbits. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of end points in Appendix A.For Bacillus pumilus QST 2808, default MRL of 0.01 mg/kg is established according to Art 18(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. There are no MRL changes since the entry into force of the Regulation mentioned above.For the purpose of this MRL review, all the uses of Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 currently authorised within the EU as submitted by the Member States during the GAP collection, have been reported by the RMS in the GAP overview file. The critical GAPs identified in the GAP overview file were subsequently summarised in the PROFile and considered in the assessment. The details of the authorised critical GAPs for Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 are given in Appendix A. The RMS did not report uses authorised in third countries that might have a significant impact on international trade.EFSA has based its assessment on the following documents:\n\nthe PROFile submitted by the RMS;\nthe evaluation report accompanying the PROFile (Netherlands, 2019);\nthe draft assessment report (DAR) and its addenda prepared under Council Directive 91/414/EEC (Netherlands, 2012, 2013);\nthe conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 (EFSA, 2013);\nthe review report on Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 (European Commission, 2014);\nThe assessment is performed in accordance with the legal provisions of the uniform principles for evaluation and authorisation of plant protection products as set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/20118 and the currently applicable guidance documents relevant for the consumer risk assessment of pesticide residues (European Commission, 1997a–g, 2000, 2010a,b, 2017; OECD, 2011, 2013).During the peer review, it was highlighted that Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 is not pathogenic to humans (EFSA, 2013). It was considered not necessary to derive reference values for Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 considering the absence of toxicity, infectivity and pathogenicity indications (European Commission, 2014). Further stp‐udies were identified which were considered necessary in relation to the approval of Bacillus pumilus QST 2808.This is particularly the case for:\n\n\n−Details on the identification of the aminosugar produced by Bacillus pumilus QST 2808,\n\n−Analysis data for the content of that aminosugar in the production batches conditions (European Commission, 2014).\nConfirmatory data to address the above data needs were provided, peer reviewed and considered as addressed by EFSA (EFSA, 2017).An important aspect for consumer safety is that Bacillus species may carry the genetic sequences that encodes for the Bacillus cereus toxins. For Bacillus pumilus QST 2808, it was demonstrated that it has very low levels of sequence homology with the Bacillus cereus genes that code for the toxins. It was concluded during the peer review that Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 does not contain the genes necessary for producing B. cereus toxins (EFSA, 2013).During the peer review, it was further noted that Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 is known to produce other toxins/secondary metabolites of which at least some of these are involved in the mode of action and that very little is known about these compounds (identity/toxicity). A data gap has been identified to address this issue during the peer review (EFSA, 2013).During this Art. 12 review, additional information on metabolites produced by Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 was provided (Netherlands, 2019). A study was performed and evaluated which specifically addressed the capacity of Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 to produce metabolites and macromolecules like proteins.Amongst 13 potentially relevant metabolites which were identified for the species Bacillus pumilus, the genetic sequences were identified in Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 coding for four metabolites (a protein and three small metabolites) which the strain was also able to express, namely binase (a ribonuclease), pumilacidins (pumilacidins A, B, C, D, E, F and G; representing a family of secondary metabolites nearly identical to surfactins), cyclo‐(L‐Pro‐L‐Leu) belonging to diketopiperazines (a diverse class of secondary metabolites produced by biosynthesis of a family of enzymes called cyclodipeptide synthase) and 3‐formylindole (a metabolite synthesised enzymatically from the amino acid tryptophan). These four metabolites were evaluated during this review and acceptable literature searches were made available.Based on the results provided in the study, it can reasonably be assumed that the formation of other metabolites than these four identified on plants following the application of Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 can be excluded.Information provided from literature searches during this review indicates that these four identified metabolites produced by Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 are not toxic to humans and no evidence for genotoxicity was reported. However, studies in compliance with the current data requirements were not provided to characterise and to assess the toxicology of these compounds.During the peer review, methods to enumerate viable counts of Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 were provided. The strain Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 was distinguished from other Bacillus pumilus strains by ribotyping, an approach based on DNA sequence homology (EFSA, 2013). These methods were considered appropriate during this review.Methods to identify metabolites based on hyphenated LC MS/MS were used in the studies provided during this Art. 12 review (Netherlands, 2019). It is however also noted that these methods were not presented as sufficiently validated in plant commodities and that the limit of quantification (LOQ) was not reported. Quantitative information on the concentrations of the metabolites on plant commodities following the use of Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 under GAP relevant conditions in accordance with a fully validated analytical method would still be considered desirable.Noting that methods for monitoring are not required at present, the availability of sufficiently validated qualitative and quantitative methods for verification of viable counts, for identification of the strain Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 and of its metabolites post application (after treatment) on plants and postharvest in cases of need is considered important.Considering the authorised GAPs of this review, viable counts of Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 of 1.435 × 1011 CFU/ha (which is calculated to correspond to 1.435 × 103 CFU/cm2) are applied at each of up to six applications. However, higher counts can be expected on plant surfaces since (targeted) foliar application is authorised. Counts can be estimated as being below 105 CFU/mm2 plant commodity surface at the time of harvest based on viable count decline curves provided during the peer review (Netherlands, 2013).It is further noted that the representative uses on grapes and fruiting vegetables (evaluated during the peer review) had around 50–100 times higher amounts of colony forming units (CFUs) per hectare per treatment than the European authorised GAPs assessed in this Art. 12 review. In addition, the representative uses of the peer review had up to three times the number of maximum applications than the authorised GAPs in this Art. 12 review (see Appendix A). During the peer review, it was also shown that viable counts following treatment of plants were declining and did not persist or increase (EFSA, 2013).Although fungicidal compounds are considered to be involved in the antagonistic activity of Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 against plant pathogenic fungi, their formation and occurrence on leaf and fruit surfaces was reported only as transient during the growth phase to suppress growth of competitors for nutrient sources and these metabolites do not accumulate after treatment. Furthermore, since metabolites’ production is correlated with active growth of Bacillus pumilus QST 2808, their formation following application is expected to be minimal (Netherlands, 2019). This would be desirably confirmed considering the assessment of data to address the magnitude of the identified metabolites.The absence of hazardous properties of the strain and of its metabolites is one of the criteria for the inclusion of active substances into Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 (European Commission, 2015).Based on expert judgement, the consumer dietary risk assessment can be considered as finalised because the metabolites do not have identified hazardous properties, noting that the determination of the magnitude of residues of the metabolites on plant commodities would be desirable.With regard to the five assessment criteria according to the Commission guidance (European Commission, 2015) for potential inclusion of Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 in Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, only criterion 3 was considered met for the following reasons:\n\nBacillus pumilus QST 2808 is not approved as a basic substance under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 and not included into Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005;\nBacillus pumilus QST 2808 and metabolites of Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 have no identified hazardous properties. However, the quantity of metabolites on plants was not addressed and a sufficiently validated method including an LOQ was not presented which is still considered as desirable;\nit is not demonstrated that Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 and its metabolites were below natural background levels, however, since hazardous properties are not identified for Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 and its metabolites this is not expected to be of dietary consumer concern;\nconsumer exposure to Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 and its metabolites following application on plants postharvest cannot be excluded, however, since hazardous properties are not identified for Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 and its metabolites this is not expected to be of dietary consumer concern.\nConsidering the overall assessment of the available data and based on expert judgement in this case, it is proposed to include Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 in Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 since criterion 3 of the guidance document on criteria for the inclusion of active substances into Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 (European Commission, 2015) is considered fulfilled (EFSA, 2019b). Therefore, it can be concluded that while criteria 1, 2, 4 and 5 are not demonstrated or applicable, it can be reasonably assumed that there is no dietary risk to consumers.The conclusion of the peer review that Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 is not hazardous to humans remains supported by this review considering new information received on its potential to produce four metabolites that were identified as binase, pumilacidins, cyclo‐(L‐Pro‐L‐Leu) and 3‐formylindole.The metabolites are not considered hazardous for the consumer dietary exposure based on the available body of knowledge in the literature. However, they have not been quantified on the plants and sufficiently validated methods for their quantification are not presented which is considered as desirable.The consumer dietary risk assessment with regard to the use of Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 according to the authorised uses can be finalised based on an expert judgement in this case considering that the metabolites have no identified hazardous properties.Following the assessment according to the criteria defined by the European Commission for inclusion of pesticide active substances into Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, an inclusion of Bacillus pumilus QST 2808 is recommended.\n\n\n\n\na.i.\n\nactive ingredient\n\n\n\n\na.s.\n\nactive substance\n\n\n\n\nBBCH\n\ngrowth stages of mono‐ and dicotyledonous plants\n\n\n\n\nbw\n\nbody weight\n\n\n\n\nCFU\n\nColony forming unit\n\n\n\n\nDAR\n\ndraft assessment report\n\n\n\n\nEMA\n\nEuropean Medicines Agency (former EMEA)\n\n\n\n\nEMS\n\nevaluating Member State\n\n\n\n\neq\n\nresidue expressed as a.s. equivalent\n\n\n\n\nEURLs\n\nEuropean Union Reference Laboratories for Pesticide Residues (former CRLs)\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organisation for Standardization\n\n\n\n\nKoc\n\norganic carbon adsorption coefficient\n\n\n\n\nLC\n\nliquid chromatography\n\n\n\n\nLC–MS/MS\n\nliquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nLOQ\n\nlimit of quantification\n\n\n\n\nMRL\n\nmaximum residue level\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nMember States\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nmass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nMS/MS\n\ntandem mass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nOECD\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development\n\n\n\n\nPHI\n\npreharvest interval\n\n\n\n\nPow\n\npartition coefficient between n‐octanol and water\n\n\n\n\nppm\n\nparts per million (10−6)\n\n\n\n\nPROFile\n\n(EFSA) Pesticide Residues Overview File\n\n\n\n\nRMS\n\nrapporteur Member State\n\n\n\n\nSANCO\n\nDirectorate‐General for Health and Consumers\n\n\n\n\nSC\n\nsuspension concentrate\n\n\n"

        "summary": "In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation ( ) No 396/2005, the applicant Tilco‐Alginure GmbH submitted a request to the competent national authority in Germany to modify the existing maximum residue levels ( ) for the active substance potassium phosphonates in flowering brassica, Chinese cabbages, kales and spinaches. The data submitted in support of the request were found to be sufficient to derive   proposals for all the crops under assessment. Adequate analytical methods for enforcement are available to control residues of potassium phosphonates in the crops under assessment. Based on the risk assessment results,   concluded that the long‐term intake of residues resulting from the use of potassium phosphonates according to the reported agricultural practices is unlikely to present a risk to consumer health. The consumer risk assessment shall be regarded as indicative and a more realistic intake assessment will be performed in the framework of the   review for potassium phosphonates. The reliable end points, appropriate for use in regulatory risk assessment are presented.",
        "full-text": "In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, Tilco‐Alginure GmbH submitted an application to the competent national authority in Germany (evaluating Member State, EMS) to modify the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for the active substance potassium phosphonates in flowering brassica, Chinese cabbages, kales and spinaches. The EMS drafted an evaluation report in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on 11 December 2019. To accommodate for the intended uses of potassium phosphonates, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs expressed as fosetyl equivalent from 10 to 70 mg/kg in flowering brassica, from 10 to 30 mg/kg in kales and in Chinese cabbages and from 0.75 to 300 mg/kg in spinaches.EFSA assessed the application and the evaluation report as required by Article 10 of the MRL regulation.Based on the conclusions derived by EFSA in the framework of Directive 91/414/EEC, the data evaluated under previous MRL assessments and the additional data provided by the EMS in the framework of this application, the following conclusions are derived.The European Union (EU) pesticides peer review concluded that, given the elementary nature of potassium phosphonates and according to available data from public literature, the main metabolite of potassium phosphonates in plants is phosphonic acid. Studies investigating the effect of processing on the nature of potassium phosphonates (hydrolysis studies) conducted with its main metabolite demonstrated that phosphonic acid is stable. In rotational crops, the major residue was phosphonic acid.Based on the metabolic pattern identified in metabolism studies, hydrolysis studies, the toxicological significance of the metabolite, the EU pesticides peer review proposed a general residue definition for potassium phosphonates in plant products as ‘phosphonic acid and its salts, expressed as phosphonic acid’ for both enforcement and risk assessment. The current residue definition for enforcement set in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 is ‘Fosetyl‐Al (sum of fosetyl, phosphonic acid and their salts, expressed as fosetyl)’. This residue definition for enforcement is in common with other two active substances approved for use in plant protection products in the EU, disodium phosphonate and fosetyl‐Al. The residue definitions are applicable to primary crops, rotational crops and processed products.EFSA concluded that for the crops assessed in this application, the metabolism of potassium phosphonates in primary and in rotational crops and the possible degradation in processed products have been sufficiently addressed and that the previously derived residue definitions are applicable.Sufficiently validated analytical methods are available to quantify residues of potassium phosphonates in the crops assessed in this application according to the enforcement residue definition set in the EU legislation (as fosetyl equivalents) and proposed during the EU pesticides peer review (as phosphonic acid). The methods enable quantification of residues at or above an limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.01 mg fosetyl/kg and 0.1 mg phosphonic acid/kg.The available residue trials are sufficient to derive MRL proposals for all the crops under consideration. EFSA derived MRL proposals according to both the existing and the proposed residue definition for enforcement.Specific studies investigating the magnitude of potassium phosphonates residues in processed commodities under assessment were not provided and are not required since the individual contribution of these commodities to the theoretical maximum daily intake (TMDI) is expected to be low, below the trigger value of 10% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI)I.Based on the available information, EFSA could not exclude that the uses of potassium phosphonates according to the proposed Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) will not result in significant residues of phosphonic acid in rotational crops. Therefore, Member States should consider the need for setting specific risk mitigation measures to avoid the presence of potassium phosphonates residues in rotational crops.As kales could be used as feed products, a potential carry‐over into food of animal origin was assessed. Comparing the results of the dietary burden calculation obtained including residues expected from the intended use in kales with the dietary burden derived previously (without residues expected in kales), it is evident that the residues in kales have negligible impact on the expected livestock exposure, which are mainly driven by the existing uses. Hence, no modification of the MRLs set for animal commodities is required.The toxicological profile of potassium phosphonates was assessed in the framework of the EU pesticides peer review under Directive 91/414/EEC and the data were sufficient to derive an ADI of 2.25 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day for phosphonic acid, which is the toxicologically relevant metabolite of potassium phosphonates in products of plant and animal origin. An acute reference dose (ARfD) was deemed unnecessary.The consumer risk assessment was performed with revision 3.1 of the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo). For the calculation of the chronic exposure, EFSA used the median residue values (STMR) as derived from the residue trials on the crops under consideration, the STMR available from previously issued EFSA opinions and from recently implemented Codex MRLs. For the remaining commodities of plant and animal origin, the existing MRLs as established in the EU legislation, recalculated to express them as phosphonic acid, were included in the risk assessment. Using the toxicological reference value set for potassium phosphonates, no long‐term consumer intake concerns were identified; the calculated long‐term exposure accounted for a maximum of 48% of the ADI (DE child diet).EFSA performed an indicative risk assessment using the proposed revised ADI of 1 mg/kg bw per day applicable to phosphonic acid according to the recent EFSA conclusion on fosetyl, noting that the value is not yet formally adopted. The long‐term dietary exposure accounted for a maximum of 97% of the ADI (DE child, NL toddler). The contribution of residues in the crops under consideration is minor (all individually below 4% of the ADI). When excluding from this exposure calculation, the commodities for which the existing EU MRL is set at the LOQ, assuming that no uses are authorised on these crops and taking into account the peeling factor for citrus fruits, the overall chronic exposure to phosphonic acid residues is below the ADI (91% of the ADI (DE child)). All these exposure calculations shall be regarded as indicative since information on the contribution for all authorised uses and all sources leading to residues of phosphonic acid is not available at this stage. For a number of products, the exposure calculations were performed with the MRL instead of the STMR which is likely to overestimate the exposure to residues arising from the use of potassium phosphonates in plants.EFSA concluded that the proposed use of potassium phosphonates on flowering brassica, Chinese cabbages, kales and spinaches will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a risk to consumers’ health.As the review of the existing MRLs under Article 12 of Regulation 396/2005 is not yet finalised, the conclusions reported in this reasoned opinion are indicative and may need to be reconsidered in the light of the outcome of the MRL review.EFSA proposes to amend the existing MRLs as reported in the summary table below.Full details of all endpoints and the consumer risk assessment can be found in Appendices B–D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodea\n\nCommodity\nExisting EU MRL (mg/kg)\nProposed EU MRL (mg/kg)\nComment/justification\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforcement residue definition:\n\n1) Existing enforcement residue definition: fosetyl‐Al (sum of fosetyl, phosphonic acid and their salts, expressed as fosetyl)\n2) Proposed enforcement residue definition: phosphonic acid and its salts, expressed as phosphonic acid\n\n\n\n0241000\nFlowering brassica\n10\n\n1) 70\n2) 50\n\nThe submitted data on broccoli and cauliflowers are sufficient to derive an MRL proposal for the intended NEU use on flowering brassica by extrapolation.

The detailed description of the intended uses which are the basis for the current MRL application is reported in Appendix A.Potassium phosphonates is the name commonly used for potassium hydrogen phosphonate and dipotassium phosphonate (IUPAC names). The chemical structures of the active substance, related active substances and its main metabolite are reported in Appendix E.Potassium phosphonates was evaluated in the framework of Directive 91/414/EEC1 with France designated as rapporteur Member State (RMS) for the representative use as a foliar spraying on grapes. The draft assessment report (DAR) prepared by the RMS has been peer reviewed by EFSA (EFSA, 2005, 2012b). Potassium phosphonates was approved2 for the use as fungicide on 1 October 2013.The process of renewal of the first approval has not yet been initiated.The EU MRLs for potassium phosphonates are established in Annex IIIA of Regulation (EC) No 396/20053. The current residue definition for enforcement is set as the ‘sum of fosetyl, phosphonic acid and their salts, expressed as fosetyl’. Thus, the existing MRLs reflect the use of fosetyl‐(Aluminium), disodium phosphonate or potassium phosphonates leading to the higher residue. The review of the existing MRLs under Article 12 of Regulation 396/2005 is not yet finalised. For fosetyl, the MRL review is completed (EFSA, 2012a). However, the modifications of the existing MRLs proposed have not yet been legally implemented since it is appropriate to await the MRL review for the related active substances, i.e. potassium phosphonates and disodium phosphonate, as these active substances share the common metabolite phosphonic acid. EFSA has issued several reasoned opinions on the modification of MRLs for potassium phosphonates (EFSA, 2018b,d, 2019b, 2020). The proposals from these reasoned opinions have been considered in recent MRL regulation(s).4 Certain Codex maximum residue limits (CXLs) have been taken over in the EU MRL legislation.5In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, Tilco‐Alginure GmbH submitted an application to the competent national authority in Germany (evaluating Member State, EMS) to modify the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for the active substance potassium phosphonates in flowering brassica, Chinese cabbages, kales and spinaches. The EMS drafted an evaluation report in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on 11 December 2019. To accommodate for the intended uses of potassium phosphonates, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs expressed as fosetyl equivalent from 10 to 70 mg/kg in flowering brassica, from 10 to 30 mg/kg in kales and in Chinese cabbages and from 0.75 to 300 mg/kg in spinaches.EFSA based its assessment on the evaluation report submitted by the EMS (Germany, 2019), the draft assessment report (DAR) and its addendum on potassium phosphonates (France, 2005, 2012) prepared under Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the renewal assessment report (RAR) on fosetyl (France, 2017, 2019) prepared under Regulation (EU) No 1107/20096, the Commission review report on potassium phosphonates (European Commission, 2013), the conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substances potassium phosphonates (EFSA, 2012b) and fosetyl (EFSA, 2018c), as well as the conclusions from previous EFSA opinions on potassium phosphonates and fosetyl (EFSA, 2009, 2012c, 2015, 2018b,d, 2019b, 2020, and the MRL review of fosetyl (EFSA, 2012a).For this application, the data requirements established in Regulation (EU) No 544/20117 and the guidance documents applicable at the date of submission of the application to the EMS are applicable (European Commission, 1997a, b, c, d, e, f, g, 2000, 2010a, b, 2013, 2017; OECD, 2011, 2013). The assessment is performed in accordance with the legal provisions of the Uniform Principles for the Evaluation and the Authorisation of Plant Protection Products adopted by Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/20118.As the review of the existing MRLs under Article 12 of Regulation 396/2005 is not yet finalised, the conclusions reported in this reasoned opinion may need to be reconsidered in the light of the outcome of the MRL review.A selected list of end points of the studies assessed by EFSA in the framework of this MRL application including the end points of relevant studies assessed previously, are presented in Appendix B.The evaluation report submitted by the EMS (Germany, 2019) and the exposure calculations using the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) are considered as supporting documents to this reasoned opinion and, thus, are made publicly available as background documents to this reasoned opinion.The use of potassium phosphonates resulted in significant residue levels in kales which might be fed to livestock. Therefore, EFSA assessed whether the intended use of potassium phosphonates required a modification of the MRLs set for animal commodities.EFSA updated the most recent animal dietary burden for potassium phosphonates calculated using the feeding tables listed in the OECD guidance (OECD, 2013) by including the residues in kales expected from the intended use of potassium phosphonates. The input values for the exposure calculation for livestock are presented in Appendix D.1. The results of the dietary burden calculation are presented in Appendix B.2.Comparing the results of the revised dietary burden calculation with the dietary burden derived previously (EFSA, 2019b), it is evident that the residues in kales have a negligible impact on the expected livestock exposure and a modification of the MRLs set for animal commodities is not required.Nevertheless, the livestock exposure to potassium phosphonates residues and the potential carry‐over of phosphonic acid residues into commodities of animal origin will be further investigated in the framework of Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 when full information on authorised uses will be available to EFSA.EFSA performed a dietary risk assessment using version 3.1 of the EFSA PRIMo (EFSA, 2018a). This exposure assessment model contains the relevant European food consumption data for different sub‐groups of the EU population (EFSA, 2019a). The assessment was performed according to the residue definition ‘phosphonic acid and its salts, expressed as phosphonic acid’.The toxicological profile for potassium phosphonates was assessed in the framework of the EU pesticide peer review of this active substance (EFSA, 2012b). Considering that phosphonic acid is the relevant component of residues in plant and animal products, the acceptable daily intake (ADI) derived was related to phosphonic acid and was set at 2.25 mg/kg bw per day (European Commission, 2013). Later, as phosphonic acid is a metabolite in common with fosetyl, during the process of the renewal of the approval for fosetyl‐Al, a revised ADI of 1 mg/kg bw per day has been derived and considered applicable also to phosphonic acid (EFSA, 2018c). Although this ADI is not yet formally adopted, an indicative risk assessment has been calculated according to this reference value as well. The short‐term exposure assessment is not required since no ARfD is established or proposed.For the calculation of the chronic exposure, EFSA used the median residue values (STMR) as derived from the residue trials on the crops under consideration, the STMR reported in previously issued EFSA reasoned opinions (EFSA, 2012c, 2015, 2018b,d, 2019b, 2020) and the STMRs of the recently implemented Codex MRLs (FAO, 2017). For the remaining commodities of plant and animal origin, in the absence of risk assessment values for refinement, the existing MRLs set in the EU legislation for fosetyl‐Al, recalculated to phosphonic acid,12 were used.Considering the current ADI of 2.25 mg/kg bw per day for phosphonic acid (scenario 1), the estimated long‐term dietary exposure accounted for a maximum of 48% of the ADI (DE child).EFSA also performed an indicative risk assessment using the revised ADI of 1 mg/kg bw per day proposed to be applied to phosphonic acid in the framework of the EU pesticides peer review of fosetyl (scenario 2, option a). The long‐term dietary exposure accounted for a maximum of 97% of the ADI (DE child, NL toddler), with apples being the main contributors (29% of the ADI). The contribution of residues in the crops under consideration is minor (individually below 4% of the ADI).When excluding from the exposure calculation the commodities for which the existing EU MRL is set at the LOQ, assuming that no uses are authorised for these crops, and applying to the MRL on citrus fruits the peeling factor of 0.81 as derived in the MRL review of fosetyl (EFSA, 2012a) (Scenario 2, option b), the overall chronic exposure to phosphonic acid residues is below the ADI (91% of the ADI, DE child).The complete list of input values used in the exposure calculations is presented in Appendix D.1.EFSA concluded that the proposed use of potassium phosphonates on flowering brassica, Chinese cabbages, kales and spinaches will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a risk to consumers’ health.It is noted that all these exposure calculations shall be regarded as indicative since information on the contribution for all authorised uses and all sources leading to residues of phosphonic acid is not available at this stage. For a number of products, the exposure calculations were performed with the MRL instead of the STMR which is likely to overestimate the exposure to residues arising from the use of potassium phosphonates in plants. A more realistic consumer risk assessment will be conducted in the framework of the MRL review.The contribution of residues expected in the commodities assessed in this application to the overall long‐term exposure is presented in more detail in Appendix C. For further details on the exposure calculations, a screenshot of the Report sheet of the PRIMos (Scenario 1, 2a and 2b) are presented in Appendix C.The data submitted in support of the present MRL application were found to be sufficient to derive MRL proposals for potassium phosphonates in all crops under consideration. Adequate analytical methods for enforcement are available to control the residues of potassium phosphonates in the plant matrices under consideration.EFSA concluded that the proposed use of potassium phosphonates on the crops under consideration will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the currently set toxicological reference value for phosphonic acid. The overall calculated consumer exposure accounted for a maximum of 48% of the ADI (DE child).EFSA also performed an indicative risk assessment, using the proposed revised ADI of 1 mg/kg bw per day applicable to phosphonic acid according to the recent EFSA conclusion on fosetyl, noting that the value is not yet formally adopted. The long‐term dietary exposure accounted for a maximum of 97% of the ADI (DE child, NL toddler) and decreased to 91% of the ADI (DE child) when excluding from the calculation the products for which the existing EU MRL is set at the LOQ, assuming that no uses are authorised for these crops, and taking into account the peeling factor for citrus fruits derived in the MRL review of fosetyl. The contribution of residues in the crops under consideration to the consumer risk assessment is minor (individually below 4% of the ADI).The consumer risk assessment shall be regarded as indicative and a more realistic intake assessment will be performed in the framework of the MRL review for potassium phosphonates.The MRL recommendations are summarised in Appendix B.4.\n\n\n\n\na.s.\n\nactive substance\n\n\n\n\nADI\n\nacceptable daily intake\n\n\n\n\nARfD\n\nacute reference dose\n\n\n\n\nBBCH\n\ngrowth stages of mono‐ and dicotyledonous plants\n\n\n\n\nbw\n\nbody weight\n\n\n\n\nCF\n\nconversion factor for enforcement to risk assessment residue definition\n\n\n\n\nCXL\n\nCodex maximum residue limit\n\n\n\n\nDAR\n\ndraft assessment report\n\n\n\n\nDAT\n\ndays after treatment\n\n\n\n\nDM\n\ndry matter\n\n\n\n\nDT90\n\nperiod required for 90% dissipation (define method of estimation)\n\n\n\n\nEDI\n\nestimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nEMS\n\nevaluating Member State\n\n\n\n\neq\n\nresidue expressed as a.s. equivalent\n\n\n\n\nESI\n\nelectrospray ionisation\n\n\n\n\nEURL\n\nEU Reference Laboratory (former Community Reference Laboratory (CRL))\n\n\n\n\nFAO\n\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n\n\n\n\nFID\n\nflame ionisation detector\n\n\n\n\nFLD\n\nfluorescence detector\n\n\n\n\nFPD\n\nflame photometric detector\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nGC\n\ngas chromatography\n\n\n\n\nGCPF\n\nGlobal Crop Protection Federation (formerly International Group of National Associations of Manufacturers of Agrochemical Products (GIFAP))\n\n\n\n\nGC‐FID\n\ngas chromatography with flame ionisation detector\n\n\n\n\nGC‐FPD\n\ngas chromatography with flame photometric detector\n\n\n\n\nGC‐MS\n\ngas chromatography with mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nGC‐MS/MS\n\ngas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nGR\n\ngranule\n\n\n\n\nGS\n\ngrowth stage\n\n\n\n\nHPLC\n\nhigh‐performance liquid chromatography\n\n\n\n\nHPLC‐MS\n\nhigh‐performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nHPLC‐MS/MS\n\nhigh‐performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nHR\n\nhighest residue\n\n\n\n\nIEDI\n\ninternational estimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nIESTI\n\ninternational estimated short‐term intake\n\n\n\n\nILV\n\nindependent laboratory validation\n\n\n\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organisation for Standardisation\n\n\n\n\nIUPAC\n\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n\n\n\n\nJMPR\n\nJoint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues\n\n\n\n\nKoc\n\norganic carbon adsorption coefficient\n\n\n\n\nLC\n\nliquid chromatography\n\n\n\n\nLOQ\n\nlimit of quantification\n\n\n\n\nMRL\n\nmaximum residue level\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nMember States\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nmass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nMS/MS\n\ntandem mass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nMW\n\nmolecular weight\n\n\n\n\nNEU\n\nnorthern Europe\n\n\n\n\nOECD\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development\n\n\n\n\nPAFF\n\nStanding Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed\n\n\n\n\nPBI\n\nplant back interval\n\n\n\n\nPF\n\nprocessing factor\n\n\n\n\nPHI\n\npreharvest interval\n\n\n\n\nPow\n\npartition coefficient between n‐octanol and water\n\n\n\n\nPRIMo\n\n(EFSA) Pesticide Residues Intake Model\n\n\n\n\nRA\n\nrisk assessment\n\n\n\n\nRAC\n\nraw agricultural commodity\n\n\n\n\nRD\n\nresidue definition\n\n\n\n\nRMS\n\nrapporteur Member State\n\n\n\n\nSANCO\n\nDirectorate‐General for Health and Consumers\n\n\n\n\nSEU\n\nsouthern Europe\n\n\n\n\nSL\n\nsoluble concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSTMR\n\nsupervised trials median residue\n\n\n\n\nTMDI\n\ntheoretical maximum daily intake\n\n\n\n\nWG\n\nwater‐dispersible granule\n\n\n\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n"

The α‐amylase food enzyme is intended to be used in brewing processes and distilled alcohol production. Since residual amounts of the food enzyme are removed by distillation, dietary exposure was only calculated for brewing processes. Based on the maximum use levels recommended for brewing processes, and individual data from the   Comprehensive European Food Database, dietary exposure to the food enzyme–Total Organic Solids ( ) was estimated to be up to 0.880 mg  /kg body weight (bw) per day in European populations.

        "full-text": "Article 3 of the Regulation (EC) No 1332/20081 provides definition for ‘food enzyme’ and ‘food enzyme preparation’.‘Food enzyme’ means a product obtained from plants, animals or micro‐organisms or products thereof including a product obtained by a fermentation process using micro‐organisms: (i) containing one or more enzymes capable of catalysing a specific biochemical reaction; and (ii) added to food for a technological purpose at any stage of the manufacturing, processing, preparation, treatment, packaging, transport or storage of foods.‘Food enzyme preparation’ means a formulation consisting of one or more food enzymes in which substances such as food additives and/or other food ingredients are incorporated to facilitate their storage, sale, standardisation, dilution or dissolution.Before January 2009, food enzymes other than those used as food additives were not regulated or were regulated as processing aids under the legislation of the Member States. On 20 January 2009, Regulation (EC) No 1332/2008 on food enzymes came into force. This Regulation applies to enzymes that are added to food to perform a technological function in the manufacture, processing, preparation, treatment, packaging, transport or storage of such food, including enzymes used as processing aids. Regulation (EC) No 1331/20082 established the European Union (EU) procedures for the safety assessment and the authorisation procedure of food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings. The use of a food enzyme shall be authorised only if it is demonstrated that:\n\nit does not pose a safety concern to the health of the consumer at the level of use proposed;\nthere is a reasonable technological need;\nits use does not mislead the consumer.\nAll food enzymes currently on the EU market and intended to remain on that market, as well as all new food enzymes, shall be subjected to a safety evaluation by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and approval via an EU Community list.The ‘Guidance on submission of a dossier on food enzymes for safety evaluation’ (EFSA, 2009a) lays down the administrative, technical and toxicological data required.IUBMB nomenclature: α‐amylaseSystematic name: 1,4‐α‐d‐glucan glucanohydrolaseSynonyms: glycogenaseIUBMB No.: EC 3.2.1.1CAS No.: 9000‐90‐2EINECS No.: 232‐565‐6.The α‐amylase catalyses the hydrolysis of 1,4‐α‐glucosidic linkages in starch (amylose and amylopectin), glycogen and related polysaccharides and oligosaccharides, resulting in the generation of soluble dextrins and other malto‐oligosaccharides.

        "summary": " received from the European Commission a mandate to deliver a reasoned opinion according to Article 43 of Regulation ( ) No 396/2005 on the safety of a proposed temporary maximum residue level ( ) for chlorpropham in potatoes to consumers. Sprout inhibitors based on the active substance chlorpropham have been widely used in commercial storage facilities in Europe over multiple seasons. Following the non‐renewal of approval of chlorpropham, representatives of potato trade organisations and manufacturers of chlorpropham reported an issue of cross‐contamination above the limit of quantification ( ) of untreated potatoes stored in facilities with a history of applications of chlorpropham as a post‐harvest treatment. The evaluating Member State ( ) the Netherlands, in accordance with Articles 6(2) and 16 (1)(a) of Regulation ( ) No 396/2005, submitted an application for the setting of a   for chlorpropham in potatoes in order to address the cross‐contamination in commercial storages. The   proposed to set a   for the active substance at a level ranging between 0.3 and 0.5 mg/kg. Based on the assessment of the available data and information with different methodologies, optional   proposals of 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 mg/kg were derived, and an indicative consumer risk assessment was carried out. The   proposals require further consideration by risk managers, mainly with regard to identified uncertainties, and measures for further reduction of occurrence of chlorpropham residues will also need to be considered.

        "full-text": "In accordance with Articles 6(2) and 16 (1) (a) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, an application for the setting of a temporary maximum residue level (tMRL) for chlorpropham in potatoes, in order to address the cross‐contamination in storage facilities, was submitted by the competent national authority in the Netherlands (evaluating Member State, EMS) to the European Commission. Subsequently, the European Commission, in the framework of Article 43 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, requested the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to carry out an assessment of the potential dietary exposure and risk to consumers for the temporary maximum residue level (MRL) recommended for chlorpropham by the Netherlands. The proposed temporary MRL should accommodate for residues of chlorpropham in untreated potatoes exceeding the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.01 mg/kg due to cross‐contamination from storage facilities, previously treated with a post‐harvest application.The Netherlands drafted an evaluation report in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, which was submitted to EFSA on 7 October 2019. The submission of several final study reports was still pending at the time of submission of the first evaluation report by the EMS to EFSA. Successively, EFSA identified points for further clarification that was requested from the EMS. On 10 January 2020, the EMS submitted the requested information in a revised evaluation report, which replaced the previously submitted evaluation report. The EMS proposed to set a tMRL for chlorpropham at a level ranging between 0.3 and 0.5 mg/kg depending on the data and methodology used to derive tMRLs.Based on the conclusions derived by EFSA in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, and the additional data provided by the EMS in the framework of this assessment, the following conclusions are derived.The nature of residues following cross‐contamination of untreated potatoes stored in warehouses with a history of chlorpropham treatments is sufficiently understood.Chlorpropham was shown susceptible to high temperature hydrolysis in studies simulating industrial and household processing conditions and degraded strongly under formation of 3‐chloroaniline at conditions reflecting oven‐baking of potato.The residue definition for risk assessment for potatoes and processed products thereof is derived as (1) chlorpropham (free and conjugated), expressed as chlorpropham and (2) 3‐chloroaniline (free and conjugated), expressed as 3‐chloroaniline and is only applicable to assessments conducted for contaminated potatoes. The residue definition differs from the residue definition set by the peer review for crops receiving chlorpropham treatment.The residue definition for enforcement is proposed as chlorpropham. Sufficiently validated analytical methods are available to quantify residues in contaminated potatoes according to the enforcement residue definition. The methods enable quantification of residues at or above 0.01 mg/kg (LOQ).Based on the assessment of the available data and information, different tMRL proposals ranging between 0.3 and 0.5 mg/kg were derived using different methodologies that accounted for the different quality of the available data sets. The proposed options for a tMRL require further consideration by risk managers.Tentative processing factors (PF) for the crops under assessment were derived from a processing study provided forChlorpropham – Potato/oven‐baked wedges: PF 23‐chloroaniline – Potato/oven‐baked wedges: PF 4Potatoes and their by‐products are used as feed products. The calculated livestock dietary burden exceeds the trigger value of 0.004 mg/kg body weight (bw) for all relevant animal species in separate assessments for chlorpropham (free and conjugated) and 3‐chloroaniline (free and conjugated) and further data to address specifically the carry‐over of 3‐chloroaniline and occurrence of 3‐chloro 4‐hydroxyaniline in animal commodities would normally be required to complete the consumer risk assessment. EFSA suggests that the uncertainty arising from the non‐consideration of animal commodities in the consumer risk assessment should be taken into account when the risk assessment outcome for 3‐chloroaniline is considered.The toxicological profile of chlorpropham and of 3‐chloroaniline was assessed in the framework of the EU pesticides peer review under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. The metabolite 3‐chloroaniline included in the residue definition for risk assessment is of higher toxicity than chlorpropham; therefore the two compounds should be considered separately in the risk assessment.The consumer risk assessment was performed with revision 3.1 of the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo), considering different scenarios according to the available data sets.With regard to chlorpropham, the estimated long‐term dietary intake was less than 1% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI). The short‐term exposure did not exceed the acute reference dose (ARfD) for any of the commodities assessed in four calculated scenarios, the maximum calculated exposure corresponding to 18% of the ARfD. Due to lack of data, animal commodities could not be included in the chronic and acute risk assessment.With regard to 3‐chloroaniline, the estimated long‐term dietary intake was 2% of the ADI. The short‐term exposure did not exceed the ARfD for any of the commodities assessed in two calculated scenarios, the maximum calculated exposure corresponding to 53% of the ARfD. Due to lack of data, two additional short‐term exposure scenarios could not be calculated, and animal commodities could not be included in the chronic and acute risk assessment.With the prospect that carry‐over of residues to stored potatoes will be further reduced by implementation of effective cleaning practices, EFSA concluded that the proposed options for setting an tMRL in potatoes will result in a consumer exposure unlikely exceeding the toxicological reference values for chlorpropham and 3‐chloroaniline.EFSA proposes to amend the existing MRLs as reported in the summary table below.Full details of all endpoints, including the input values considered for the exposure calculation and the consumer risk assessment can be found in Appendices A–C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodea\n\nCommodity\nExisting EU MRL (mg/kg)\nProposed EU tMRL (mg/kg)\nComment/justification\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforcement residue definition: Chlorpropham\n\n\n0211000\nPotatoes\n10\n0.3 or\n\n\nFurther risk management considerations are required\nThe tMRL was derived from monitoring data with the FAO methodology for setting an extraneous MRL, based on the 95th percentile.

The chemical structures of the active substance and its main metabolites are reported in Appendix D.Chlorpropham was initially included in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC1 with the Netherlands designated as rapporteur Member State (RMS) for the representative uses as a post‐harvest plant growth regulator for sprout suppression of potatoes and as herbicide in many edible and non‐edible crops. The process of renewal of the first approval under Regulation (EC) No 1107/20092 has been completed, and the renewal assessment report (RAR) prepared by the RMS the Netherlands (Netherlands, 2016, 2017) was peer reviewed by EFSA (EFSA, 2017a,b). Based on the EFSA conclusion, which was issued in July 2017, a decision of the non‐renewal of approval of the active substance was taken by Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/989.3The EU MRLs for chlorpropham are established in Annexes II of Regulation (EC) No 396/20054. The review of existing MRLs according to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 (MRL review) has been performed (EFSA, 2012). Proposed modifications have been implemented in the MRL legislation.5EFSA based its assessment on the evaluation report submitted by the EMS (Netherlands, 2019), the RAR (Netherlands, 2017) prepared under Regulation (EC) 1107/2009, the Commission review report on chlorpropham (European Commission, 2019), the conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance (EFSA, 2017a) and the peer review report on chlorpropham (EFSA, 2017b).For this assessment, the data requirements established in Regulation (EU) No 283/20136 and the guidance documents applicable at the date of submission to the EMS have been used (European Commission, 2000, 2010a,b, 2017; OECD, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2013). The assessment is performed in accordance with the legal provisions of the Uniform Principles for the Evaluation and the Authorisation of Plant Protection Products adopted by Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/20117.A selected list of end points of the studies assessed by EFSA in the framework of this MRL application are presented in Appendix A.The evaluation report submitted by the EMS (Netherlands, 2019) and the exposure calculations using the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) rev. 3.1 are considered as supporting documents to this reasoned opinion and, thus, are made publicly available as background documents to this reasoned opinion.On 7 October 2019, EFSA received a request from the European Commission to carry out an assessment of the potential dietary exposure and risk to consumers for the t‐MRL for chlorpropham in potatoes, as recommended in the Evaluation Report prepared by the Netherlands and to deliver a Reasoned Opinion according to Article 43 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 on the safety for consumers. The deadline to deliver the reasoned opinion was agreed to be 13 March 2020. EFSA accepted the mandate and included it in the EFSA Register of Questions with the reference number EFSA‐Q‐2019‐00653.Potatoes and their by‐products are used as feed products. The calculated livestock dietary burden exceeded the trigger value of 0.004 mg/kg body weight (bw) for all relevant animal species in separate assessments for chlorpropham and 3‐chloroaniline. The nature of chlorpropham residues in livestock has been investigated during the EU pesticides peer review (EFSA, 2017a). The conclusions by the peer review remain unchanged and further data to address specifically the carry‐over of 3‐chloroaniline and occurrence of 3‐chloro 4‐hydroxyaniline in animal commodities would normally be required to complete the consumer risk assessment. EFSA take note that the EMS considers the requirement of vertebrate studies to support a temporary MRL as inappropriate and that the setting of tMRLs for chlorpropham in commodities of animal origin is not intended. Yet, ESFA suggests that the uncertainty arising from the non‐consideration of animal commodities in the consumer risk assessment should be taken into account when the risk assessment outcome for 3‐chloroaniline is considered.EFSA performed a dietary risk assessment using revision 3.1 of the EFSA PRIMo (EFSA, 2018, 2019). This exposure assessment model contains food consumption data for different sub‐groups of the EU population and allows the acute and chronic exposure assessment to be performed in accordance with the internationally agreed methodology for pesticide residues (FAO, 2016).The toxicological reference values for chlorpropham and 3‐chloroaniline used in the risk assessment (i.e. ADI and ARfD values) were derived in the framework of the EU pesticides peer review (EFSA, 2017a). The metabolite included in the risk assessment residue definition was considered more toxic than the parent compound and therefore separate risk assessments were conducted for chlorpropham and 3‐chloroaniline.Two different data sets were used, the GLP trials and the monitoring data generated by the Potato Value Chain. The calculations were based on the HR or STMR, and where appropriate HR‐P and STMR‐P, derived from these datasets and the complete list of input values can be found in Appendix C.2.In all scenarios presented in the following sections, potential residues in animal commodities could not be taken into account due to lack of data (see Section 3).Based on the data available to support the setting of a temporary MRL for chlorpropham in potatoes in order to address cross‐contamination in storage facilities, options for setting a tMRL in potato could be proposed. The risk assessment contains assumptions that lead to non‐standard uncertainties.Because of the different quality and quantity of the data provided, i.e. GLP trials and potato industry monitoring data, the methodologies applied to derive MRL proposals differ. Four options resulting into three proposals for a temporary MRL for chlorpropham in potatoes are available for risk managers (see Appendix A.4).It is noted that the monitoring data were obtained exclusively from storages with chlorpropham use in previous seasons and without implementation of effective cleaning practices as the research in this area is still ongoing. EFSA support the EMS recommendation that manufacturers should propose an efficient and robust regime for cleaning, considering different aspects such as areas of the stores where deposits of chlorpropham might have accumulated, e.g. area on/around fans, ‘fabric of store’ including insulation material, boxes. The EMS has pointed out that some of these accumulation hotspots e.g. around the fans can be areas that are not usually cleaned and that also underground ducts are often not cleaned (Netherlands, 2019). Evidence suggests that, if insufficient cleaning combines with other factors arising from suboptimal store management practices (e.g. store loading schemes that are triggering unbalanced ventilation), the probability for contamination levels over average and possibly leading to an exceedance of the tMRL and for a risk for the consumer specifically with regard to 3‐chloroaniline exposure is significantly increased.With the prospect that carry‐over of residues to stored potatoes should be further reduced by implementation of effective cleaning practices, EFSA concluded that the short‐term and long‐term intake of residues resulting from the assessed contamination scenario for chlorpropham in ware potatoes is unlikely to result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values.\n\n\n\n\na.s.\n\nactive substance\n\n\n\n\nADI\n\nacceptable daily intake\n\n\n\n\nARfD\n\nacute reference dose\n\n\n\n\nbw\n\nbody weight\n\n\n\n\nCF\n\nconversion factor for enforcement to risk assessment residue definition\n\n\n\n\nDAR\n\ndraft assessment report\n\n\n\n\nDM\n\ndry matter\n\n\n\n\nEMS\n\nevaluating Member State\n\n\n\n\nFAO\n\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n\n\n\n\nFPSA\n\nFresh Potato Suppliers Association\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nGLP\n\nGood Laboratory Practice\n\n\n\n\nHPLC‐MS/MS\n\nhigh‐performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nHR\n\nhighest residue\n\n\n\n\nIEDI\n\ninternational estimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nIESTI\n\ninternational estimated short‐term intake\n\n\n\n\nILV\n\nindependent laboratory validation\n\n\n\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organisation for Standardisation\n\n\n\n\nIUPAC\n\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n\n\n\n\nLOQ\n\nlimit of quantification\n\n\n\n\nMRL\n\nmaximum residue level\n\n\n\n\nNEU\n\nnorthern Europe\n\n\n\n\nOECD\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development\n\n\n\n\nPF\n\nprocessing factor\n\n\n\n\nPRIMo\n\n(EFSA) Pesticide Residues Intake Model\n\n\n\n\nQuEChERS\n\nQuick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (analytical method)\n\n\n\n\nRA\n\nrisk assessment\n\n\n\n\nRAC\n\nraw agricultural commodity\n\n\n\n\nRD\n\nresidue definition\n\n\n\n\nRMS\n\nrapporteur Member State\n\n\n\n\nSANCO\n\nDirectorate‐General for Health and Consumers\n\n\n\n\nSEU\n\nsouthern Europe\n\n\n\n\nSTMR\n\nsupervised trials median residue\n\n\n\n\nt‐MRL\n\ntemporary maximum residue level\n\n\n"

The context of the peer review was that required by Commission Implementing Regulation ( ) No 844/2012 as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation ( ) No 2018/1659. The conclusions were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of   strain Ve6 as an insecticide on fruiting vegetables of cucurbitaceae with edible and inedible peel, fruiting vegetables of solanaceae, strawberries, floriculture crops (except roses), cut roses and tree nursery. The reliable end points, appropriate for use in regulatory risk assessment, are presented. Missing information identified as being required by the regulatory framework is listed. Concerns are identified.",
        "full-text": "Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/20121, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/16592, lays down the procedure for the renewal of the approval of active substances submitted under Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. The list of those substances is established in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 686/2012, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/183. Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6 is one of the active substances listed in Regulation (EU) No 2016/183. The species has been re‐named to Akanthomyces muscarius during the peer review process. Already in 2001, the species was reclassified from Verticillium lecani to Lecanicillium muscarium.In accordance with Article 1 of Regulation (EU) No 844/2012, the rapporteur Member State (RMS), the Netherlands, and co‐rapporteur Member State (co‐RMS), France, received an application from Koppert B.V. for the renewal of approval of the active substance Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve 6, which is now named Akanthomyces muscarius strain Ve6.An initial evaluation of the dossier on Akanthomyces muscarius strain Ve6 was provided by the RMS in the renewal assessment report (RAR) and subsequently, a peer review of the pesticide risk assessment on the RMS evaluation was conducted by EFSA in accordance with Article 13 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/1659. The following conclusions are derived.The uses of Akanthomyces muscarius strain Ve6 according to the representative uses as an insecticide on fruiting vegetables of cucurbitaceae with edible and inedible peel, fruiting vegetables of solanaceae, strawberries, floriculture crops (except roses), cut roses and tree nursery, as proposed at European Union (EU) level result in a sufficient insecticidal efficacy against the target organisms.In the mammalian toxicology section, no concern or data gap has been identified with regard to the microorganism itself. It has been shown that the strain under evaluation would not produce destruxins, either in the formulated product or after application. However, such information could not be retrieved for the other metabolites potentially produced by Akanthomyces spp. A data gap has been identified for information on the toxicity of these secondary metabolites, should they be produced in the formulated product or after application.Based on the available information, it cannot be excluded that exposure of humans to viable residues (both spores and mycelium) may occur. However, this can be considered acceptable based on the available information that residual spores and cells have no adverse health effects. However, a data gap was identified regarding toxicity of unidentified potentially produced secondary metabolites and consequently their consumer relevance cannot be assessed.The information and evidence provided was considered insufficient to conclude on the likely competitiveness, persistence and multiplication of Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 in soil and surface water.For the representative use in high technology (permanent) greenhouses, the assessment of the potential for infectivity and pathogenicity in aquatic organisms could not be finalised. For the representative use to strawberries in walk‐in tunnels, the assessment of the potential for infectivity and pathogenicity in aquatic organisms, bees, non‐target arthropods and the assessment to soil microorganism communities could not be finalised. As the identification of secondary metabolites produced in the environment was not finalised, the risk to non‐target organisms from such metabolites could also not be finalised.Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012 as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/1659 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Regulation’), lays down the provisions for the procedure of the renewal of the approval of active substances, submitted under Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/20093. This regulates for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) the procedure for organising the consultation of Member States, the applicant(s) and the public on the initial evaluation provided by the rapporteur Member State (RMS) and/or co‐rapporteur Member State (co‐RMS) in the renewal assessment report (RAR), and the organisation of an expert consultation where appropriate.In accordance with Article 13 of the Regulation, unless formally informed by the European Commission that a conclusion is not necessary, EFSA is required to adopt a conclusion on whether the active substance can be expected to meet the approval criteria provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 within 5 months from the end of the period provided for the submission of written comments, subject to an extension of up to 3 months where additional information is required to be submitted by the applicant(s) in accordance with Article 13(3).In accordance with Article 1 of the Regulation, the RMS, the Netherlands, and co‐RMS, France, received an application from Koppert B.V. for the renewal of approval of the active substance Akanthomyces muscarius strain Ve6. The species was previously named Lecanicillium muscarium. Complying with Article 8 of the Regulation, the RMS checked the completeness of the dossier and informed the applicant, the co‐RMS (France), the European Commission and EFSA about the admissibility.The RMS provided its initial evaluation of the dossier on Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 in the RAR, which was received by EFSA on 30 January 2018 (Netherlands, 2018a).In accordance with Article 12 of the Regulation, EFSA distributed the RAR to the Member States and the applicant, Koppert B.V., for consultation and comments on 15 May 2018. EFSA also provided comments. In addition, EFSA conducted a public consultation on the RAR. EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the European Commission on 16 July 2018. At the same time, the collated comments were forwarded to the RMS for compilation and evaluation in the format of reporting table. In addition, the applicant was invited to respond to the comments received. The applicant responded to the comments in column 3 of the reporting table. The comments and the applicant's response were evaluated by the RMS in column 3.The need for expert consultation and the necessity for additional information to be submitted by the applicant in accordance with Article 13(3) of the Regulation were considered in a telephone conference between EFSA, the RMS on 17 August 2018. On the basis of the comments received, the applicant's response to the comments and the RMS's evaluation thereof, it was concluded that additional information should be requested from the applicant and that there was no need to conduct an expert consultation.The outcome of the telephone conference, together with EFSA's further consideration of the comments, is reflected in the conclusions set out in column 4 of the reporting table. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase and which required further consideration, were compiled by EFSA in the format of an evaluation table.The conclusions arising from the consideration by EFSA, and as appropriate by the RMS, of the points identified in the evaluation table and the written consultation on the assessment of additional information, where these took place, were reported in the final column of the evaluation table.A final consultation on the conclusions arising from the peer review of the risk assessment took place with Member States via a written procedure in March 2019.This conclusion report summarises the outcome of the peer review of the risk assessment of the active substance and the representative formulation, evaluated on the basis of the representative uses of Akanthomyces muscarius strain Ve6 as an insecticide on fruiting vegetables of cucurbitaceae with edible and inedible peel, fruiting vegetables of solanaceae, strawberries, floriculture crops (except roses), cut roses and tree nursery, as proposed by the applicant. In accordance with Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, risk mitigation options identified in the RAR and considered during the peer review are presented in the conclusion. A list of the relevant end points for the active substance and the formulation is provided in Appendix A.In addition, a key supporting document to this conclusion is the peer review report (EFSA, 2019), which is a compilation of the documentation developed to evaluate and address all issues raised in the peer review, from the initial commenting phase to the conclusion. The peer review report comprises the following documents, in which all views expressed during the course of the peer review, including minority views, where applicable, can be found:\n\nthe comments received on the RAR;\nthe reporting table (17 August 2018);\nthe evaluation table (28 February 2019);\nthe comments received on the assessment of the additional information;\nthe comments received on the draft EFSA conclusion.\nGiven the importance of the RAR, including its revisions (Netherlands, 2018b), and the peer review report, both documents are considered as background documents to this conclusion and thus are made publicly available.It is recommended that this conclusion report and its background documents would not be accepted to support any registration outside the EU for which the applicant has not demonstrated that it has regulatory access to the information on which this conclusion report is based.Lecanicillium muscarium isolate 19‐79 (strain Ve6) is a fungus deposited to the CBS Filamentous Fungi database4 under accession number CBS 102071, to the ARS Collection of Entomopathogenic Fungal Cultures (ARSEF) under accession number ARSEF 5128. The strain has been formerly classified as Verticillium lecanii Ve6. (CABI Genetic Resource Collection, CABI(=IMI) 268317). The current taxonomy of the species Lecanicillium muscarium has been revised and L. muscarium is classified now as Akanthomyces muscarius. Sequences of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and three mitochondrial genes of Akanthomyces muscarius strain Ve6 are deposited at the GeneBank (National Center for Biotechnology Information, USA) under accession numbers EF512971 and EF513028, respectively. Akanthomyces muscarius strain Ve6 is worldwide occurring fungus, first isolated in 1979 from the glasshouse whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum.The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ‘MYCOTAL WG’, a water dispersible granule (WG) containing 1 × 1013 spores/kg (declared range 9.5 × 1012 to 1.2 × 1013 spores/kg and 5.3 × 1012 to 8.9 × 1012 CFU/kg, respectively) or 48 g/kg Akanthomyces muscarius strain Ve6. An FAO specification does not exist for this product.The representative uses evaluated as insecticide against thrips and whitefly comprise spray applications in fruiting vegetables of cucurbitaceae with edible and inedible peel, fruiting vegetables of solanaceae, strawberries, floriculture crops (except roses), cut roses and tree nursery. Full details of the Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) can be found in the list of end points in Appendix A.Data were submitted to conclude that the uses of Akanthomyces muscarius strain Ve6 according to the representative uses proposed at EU level result in a sufficient efficacy as an insecticide against whitefly and thrips, following the guidance document SANCO/2012/11251‐rev. 4 (European Commission, 2014).The following guidance documents were followed in the production of this conclusion: European Commission, 2012 and EFSA, 2012.The technical grade microbial pest control agent (MPCA) is only a hypothetical stage in the continuous production process of the end use product (MPCP). As a consequence, the specification is given only for the end‐use product ‘MYCOTAL WG’, containing minimum 5.3 × 1012 CFU/kg, (9.5 × 1012 spores/kg) of Akanthomyces muscarius strain Ve6.Mitochondrial restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was shown to distinguish Akanthomyces muscarius strain Ve6 from strains of the same species. The sequences of internal transcribed spacer 1, 5.8 S ribosomal RNA gene, internal transcribed spacer 2 (complete sequence) and small subunit of ribosomal RNA (rns) gene (partial sequence; mitochondrial) are used for Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 identification on DNA level.The analysis of contaminating microorganisms in commercially produced batches complies with the requirements of the Working Document on Microbial Contaminant Limits (European Commission, 2012).Akanthomyces muscarius is not known to be related to any human or animal pathogen, or to fungi with adverse effects to the environment.The possible production of destruxin A, B and E were evaluated for Akanthomyces muscarius strain Ve6 in liquid cultures, in rice cultures and solid agar medium, using high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses and mass spectroscopy. Destruxins were not detected neither in the non‐formulated spores nor in the product MYCOTAL WG. Destruxins were not found on tomato and cucumber plants after a foliar application of MYCOTAL at a dose of 108 spores/mL of spray (2 × 1014 spores/ha, i.e. 10 times the recommended dose, three applications at one week interval).Akanthomyces muscarius strain Ve6 can grow between 5 and 30°C with the optimal growth temperature of 25°C. There was no growth seen above 37°C.Specific information addressing the issue of resistance/sensitivity to antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents of Akanthomyces muscarius strain Ve6 has not been presented; as a consequence, a data gap was identified for further assessment. It should be noted that the RMS disagreed with the setting of a data gap.Acceptable methods are available for the determination of the microorganism content in the formulation. A data gap was identified for the storage stability of MYCOTAL in aluminium bags.A residue definition was not applicable for Akanthomyces muscarius strain Ve6; therefore, post‐registration monitoring methods are not needed.\nGeneral data\nAkanthomyces muscarius strain Ve6 was renamed from Lecanicillium muscarium Ve6 or Lecanicillium lecanii Ve6 (formerly Verticillium lecanii Ve6). These references were kept for the literature search that was updated considering also the relevant metabolites potentially formed by the microbial control agent (MCA). The microorganism has a worldwide geographic distribution in soils, other fungi and plant material. It is not a known human or mammalian pathogen. Spores of Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 germinate and grow between 5°C and 30°C. At 37°C, germination of some spores was obtained, but no further growth occurred, indicating its inability to colonise warm‐blooded animals. Several papers describe clinical cases of human infection related to immunocompromised people or after trauma. Sensitisation potential was suspected by serology testing; however, an assessment of the symptoms was either not conducted to allow a conclusion on the sensitisation properties of the MCA or there were no indications of sensitisation or inflammatory lung diseases under pilot conditions and among greenhouse workers.\nToxicity studies\nBased on acute toxicity studies by oral, intravenous, inhalation and intraperitoneal routes, the MCA did not exhibit infectivity or pathogenicity potential; however, signs of toxicity were observed after intraperitoneal administration, most probably unspecific local effects derived from intraperitoneal injection of proteinaceous material. Local effects were also observed in the lungs after short‐term administration of the formulation by inhalation. Genotoxicity tests were provided on the MCA (Ames and Vitotox tests) and formulated product (Ames test) giving negative results. In vitro clastogenicity was not investigated, which would only be needed if strain‐specific relevant metabolites would be identified (see paragraph below).\nSecondary metabolites\nThe possible metabolites identified for the species A. muscarius comprise bassianolide, vertilecanins, vermalin A and B, lecanindole, lecanicillone A‐C, lecanicilloid, destruxin and verticilide as assessed from peer‐reviewed literature on the biological properties. Destruxins have been shown to be relevant secondary metabolites based on a broad spectrum of references evaluating possible effects of destruxins, or destruxin B in particular, to apoptosis in human carcinoma cells. As part of the EU RAFBCA‐project5 (final report submitted with the dossier), genotoxicity of Akanthomyces muscarius was studied on a number of different Salmonella Typhimurium strains and on E. coli strains with polar and non‐polar extracts of unformulated spores of ‘Mycotal’ and extracts from the preparation ‘Mycotal’. No mutagenic effects were found with any of these crude extracts, which would contain all possible metabolites. A statement was provided indicating that pure metabolites were also tested including destruxins A and that no mutagenic effects were found.It has been shown that the strain under evaluation would not produce destruxins, either in the formulated product or after application. Such information could, however, not be retrieved for the other metabolites. In the environmental fate section of the RAR, it is stated that adequate information to address the potential for Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 to produce secondary metabolites/toxins was not available. Accordingly a data gap has been identified for information on the toxicity of secondary metabolites/toxins such as bassianolide, vertilecanins, vermalin A and B, lecanindole, lecanicillone A‐C, lecanicilloid and verticilide should they be produced by Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6. The RMS did not agree with the setting of this data gap, considering that the microorganism is commonly found in the environment and has been used for many years as plant protection product, taking into consideration that testing of the crude extract did not raise concern and that the literature search did not reveal information relevant to human health (or the environment), the RMS concluded that enough information is available to address the toxicological relevance of metabolites.\nReference values and non‐dietary exposure\nIt is generally accepted that no reference values (acceptable daily intake – ADI, acute reference dose – ARfD, acceptable operator exposure level – AOEL or acute acceptable operator exposure level – AAOEL) are needed in cases where the microorganism is not pathogenic or infective and does not produce toxins (which remains to be confirmed). Accordingly, no exposure risk assessment would be needed. It is noted that operators and workers are recommended to use personal protective equipment (PPE) because all microorganisms are regarded as potential sensitisers (via the dermal and inhalation routes). Considering the data gap identified for secondary metabolites/toxins except destruxins, operator and worker exposure could not be finalised – as mentioned above, the RMS considered this issue sufficiently addressed. Assuming that the product is used in high technology (permanent) greenhouses or tunnels that are closed during application and 12 hours afterwards, bystanders and residents are unlikely to be exposed to the MCA.Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 is intended to be used on cucumber, tomato, sweet pepper, strawberries and ornamentals, the latter are not relevant for dietary consumer exposure. A preharvest interval (PHI) of one day is included in the GAP. Recently updated information on the active strain Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 indicates that it does not produce destruxins. However, notably not all potentially relevant metabolites which the strain might be able to produce based on information on the respective species were investigated.There is an indication that viable spores of the strain Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 survive for a limited time on leaves and fruits and that soon after application, a decline of spore counts is observed. Therefore, in the GAP, it is recommended to repeat foliar treatments within one week to ensure high enough viable counts of Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 for insecticidal control of plant diseases.It cannot be excluded that exposure of humans to viable residues (both spores and mycelium) may occur, but this can be considered acceptable since residual spores and cells have no adverse health effects. However, it was noted that not all potentially relevant secondary metabolites were investigated as to whether they were produced by Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 and a data gap was identified with regard to their toxicity. Therefore, since this information on potential secondary metabolites is not available, a consumer risk assessment cannot be completed considering the current state of available information further to earlier assessments (EFSA, 2016).Satisfactory information has been provided in relation to potential interference of Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 with the analytical systems for the control of the quality of drinking water provided for in Directive 98/83/EC6 (see specific Annex VI decision‐making criteria in Part II Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/20117). As these methods utilise chromogenic agents to which Akanthomyces muscarius does not give a response, it was considered unlikely that Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 would interfere with the methodologies used for such determinations.As Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 is a ‘wild type’, there are no marker genes in the strain which would permit analysis of a frequency of genetic exchange. As the genetic diversity and drift in the wild‐type population have not been ascertained, it would not be possible to distinguish any genetic drift from that in the wild population based on the information provided. Though it is acknowledged that the possibility and effects of transfer of genetic material are no different for Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 than for other naturally occurring Akanthomyces muscarius strains, transfer of genetic material by Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 after application is possible and could not be excluded based on the information in the dossier.The applicant confirmed that the representative uses to cucumber, tomatoes, sweet peppers, strawberries and floriculture crops in glasshouses were only intended for use in high technology (permanent) greenhouses.9 The risk assessment for non‐target organisms was therefore performed accordingly. The exposure assessment for a second representative use to strawberries in walk‐in tunnels was appropriately assumed to be comparable to applications in open fields; however, it is worth noting that the GAP specifies that the tunnels should be closed for 12 h after application which may reduce the potential for exposure to non‐target organisms.As discussed in Section 4, the identification and exposure assessment for secondary metabolites in the environment could not be finalised. Consequently, the risk to non‐target organisms from such metabolites cannot be assessed and a data gap is identified. This is relevant for all groups of non‐target organisms for the representative use to strawberries in walk‐in tunnels. For the representative uses in high technology (permanent) greenhouses, the data gap is relevant for aquatic organisms and soil organisms (only in the case that the secondary metabolites are persistent and when the high technology (permanent) greenhouses is removed). The RMS does not agree with the conclusion regarding the need for a risk assessment for secondary metabolites in the environment for the representative uses of Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6. The RMS is of the opinion that, as the mode of action is not via toxins, any secondary metabolites which are produced will be of insignificant amounts for non‐target organisms. Furthermore, literature searches performed by the applicant did not indicate a concern for non‐target organisms from potential secondary metabolites.As concluded in Section 2, Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 is not expected to be infectious or pathogenic in mammals. Consequently, a low risk to wild mammals from the microorganism is concluded. A study investigating the toxicity, infectivity and pathogenicity of Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 to birds was available and did not indicate any adverse effects. Consequently, a low risk to birds was concluded. Furthermore, no exposure to birds and mammals is anticipated for the representative uses to high technology (permanent) greenhouses.Only acute studies for fish and aquatic invertebrates were available. It was shown that the concentrations used in these studies resulted in a margin of safety above that expected for the representative uses of Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6. Nevertheless, owing to the short exposure and observation period in the available studies, this risk assessment cannot be considered to provide evidence regarding the potential for infectivity and pathogenicity. A report of Verticillium lecanii (the previous name for Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6) infecting the swim bladder of Baltic salmon was included in a literature study investigating the reason for mortality in a fish farm. The RMS noted a number of reliability concerns related to the study and furthermore concluded that the presence of Verticillium lecanii in the swim bladder could not be concluded to be the cause of the mortality as several other microorganisms were also detected. Owing to the reliability issues, EFSA agreed with the RMS's conclusion that this study did not confirm infectivity of Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 in fish. It was argued that the representative use of Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 is unlikely to result in the infectivity or pathogenicity of fish and aquatic invertebrates for several reasons such as low exposure, natural occurrence in aquatic water bodies, lack of evidence that aquatic organisms are in the host range and lack of reliable studies reporting infectivity in the scientific literature. However, as no substantial evidence has been provided, overall, a low risk to fish and aquatic invertebrates from infectivity and pathogenicity cannot be concluded. A data gap and issue not finalised is therefore concluded for all representative uses given that exposure of Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 to surface water is anticipated for all uses. The RMS does not agree with the need for further information and considers that the risk to aquatic organisms is low.Reliable acute toxicity data were available for honeybees. Whilst the data did not show that Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 is toxic to honeybees the data were not considered sufficient to investigate the potential for infectivity and pathogenicity. Although the RMS included several arguments to suggest that Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 is unlikely to be infectious or pathogenic to honeybees, these arguments were not considered to provide substantial evidence to exclude the potential for infectivity or pathogenicity. Furthermore, it is noted that the Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 is targeted towards the nymph stage of pests but no data on honeybee larvae were available. Therefore, a data gap was identified to further address the potential for infectivity and pathogenicity to honeybees (relevant for the representative walk‐in tunnel use to strawberries). Owing to the lack of exposure, the risk to honeybees and wild bees from the representative uses in permanent greenhouses is low. The RMS also included arguments to exclude a risk to pollinators used in greenhouses. However, no reliable data was provided to support the argumentations, and therefore, a risk to pollinators introduced to greenhouses cannot be excluded.Several papers were available which indicated that the Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 is not infectious or pathogenic to several species of non‐target arthropods. However, information was also presented that demonstrated that Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 has the capacity to infect and cause mortality of the predatory mite P. persimilis. Although the key study was not considered to be totally reliable, EFSA considers that the effects should not be disregarded. Therefore, a data gap to address the risk to non‐target arthropods is identified (relevant for the representative walk‐in tunnel use to strawberries). Owing to the lack of exposure, the risk to non‐target arthropods from the representative uses in permanent greenhouses is low.Suitable data were available and indicated that Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 is unlikely to be infectious or pathogenic to earthworms. No specific data were available demonstrating the effects of Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 on soil microorganism communities; therefore, a data gap was concluded (relevant for the representative walk‐in tunnel use to strawberries). The RMS is of the opinion that the use of microbial pesticides in general poses a low risk to soil microorganism communities which was supported by a reference to a literature study where a meta‐analysis showed that microbial antagonists could have a short‐term effect on the abundance of the fungal communities in soils but with recovery within 70 days. Owing to the lack of exposure, the risk to soil microorganisms from the representative uses in permanent greenhouses is low.This is a list of data gaps identified during the peer review process, including those areas in which a study may have been made available during the peer review process but not considered for procedural reasons (without prejudice to the provisions of Article 56 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 concerning information on potentially harmful effects).\n\nSpecific information addressing the issue of resistance/sensitivity to antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents of Akanthomyces muscarius strain Ve6 (relevant for all representative uses evaluated; see Sections 1 and 2).\nStorage stability of MYCOTAL WG in aluminium bags (relevant for all representative uses evaluated; see Section 1).\nAdequate information to address the uniform principles criterion of the strain not being expected to persist and multiply in soil or plant growing media and in surface water in concentrations considerably higher than the natural background levels, taking into account repeated applications over the years was not available (relevant for all representative uses evaluated; see Section 4).\nInformation on the toxicity of secondary metabolites/toxins such as bassianolide, vertilecanins, vermalin A and B, lecanindole, lecanicillone A‐C, lecanicilloid and verticilide (except destruxins) is missing and would be required should they be produced by Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6, since evidence for non‐production currently lacking (relevant for all representative uses evaluated; see Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5).\nFurther data are needed to address the potential of Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 for infectivity and pathogenicity to fish and aquatic organisms (relevant for all representative uses; see Section 5).\nFurther data are needed to address the potential of Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 for infectivity and pathogenicity to bees (relevant only for use to strawberries in walk‐in tunnels; see Section 5).\nFurther information is needed to address the potential of Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 to be infectious or pathogenic to non‐target arthropods (relevant only for use to strawberries in walk‐in tunnels; see Section 5).\nFurther information investigating the effects of Akanthomyces muscarius Ve6 on soil microorganism communities is needed (relevant only for use to strawberries in walk‐in tunnels; see Section 5).\n\n\n\nNone identified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/n\n\nslope of Freundlich isotherm\n\n\n\n\nλ\n\nwavelength\n\n\n\n\nε\n\ndecadic molar extinction coefficient\n\n\n\n\na.s.\n\nactive substance\n\n\n\n\nAAOEL\n\nacute acceptable operator exposure level\n\n\n\n\nADI\n\nacceptable daily intake\n\n\n\n\nAOEL\n\nacceptable operator exposure level\n\n\n\n\nAR\n\napplied radioactivity\n\n\n\n\nAR\n\nandrogen receptor\n\n\n\n\nARfD\n\nacute reference dose\n\n\n\n\nARSEF\n\nARS Collection of Entomopathogenic Fungal Cultures\n\n\n\n\nCABI\n\nCentre for Agricultural Bioscience International\n\n\n\n\nCAS\n\nChemical Abstracts Service\n\n\n\n\nCBS\n\nCentraal bureau Schimmelcultures\n\n\n\n\nCFU\n\ncolony‐forming units\n\n\n\n\nCHO\n\nChinese hamster ovary cells\n\n\n\n\nCI\n\nconfidence interval\n\n\n\n\nDAR\n\ndraft assessment report\n\n\n\n\nDAT\n\ndays after treatment\n\n\n\n\nDM\n\ndry matter\n\n\n\n\nDNA\n\ndeoxyribonucleic acid\n\n\n\n\nFAO\n\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n\n\n\n\nFOCUS\n\nForum for the Co‐ordination of Pesticide Fate Models and their Use\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nCBS\n\nFilamentous Fungi database\n\n\n\n\nHPLC\n\nhigh‐pressure liquid chromatography or high‐performance liquid chromatography\n\n\n\n\nIMI\n\nInternational Mycological Institute\n\n\n\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organization for Standardization\n\n\n\n\nITS\n\ninternal transcribed spacer\n\n\n\n\niv\n\nintravenous\n\n\n\n\nLD50\n\nlethal dose, median; dosis letalis media\n\n\n\n\nmm\n\nmillimetre (also used for mean measured concentrations)\n\n\n\n\nMOA\n\nmode of action\n\n\n\n\nMPCA\n\nactive agent of the microbial pest control product\n\n\n\n\nMPCP\n\nmicrobial pest control product\n\n\n\n\nPa\n\npascal\n\n\n\n\nPHI\n\npreharvest interval\n\n\n\n\nPow\n\npartition coefficient between n‐octanol and water\n\n\n\n\nPPE\n\npersonal protective equipment\n\n\n\n\nppm\n\nparts per million (10–6)\n\n\n\n\nr2\n\ncoefficient of determination\n\n\n\n\nRAR\n\nRenewal Assessment Report\n\n\n\n\nRFLP\n\nrestriction fragment length polymorphism\n\n\n\n\nRMS\n\nrapporteur Member State\n\n\n\n\nSD\n\nstandard deviation\n\n\n\n\nRNA\n\nribonucleic acid\n\n\n\n\nw/v\n\nweight per unit volume\n\n\n\n\nw/w\n\nweight per unit weight\n\n\n\n\nWBC\n\nwhite blood cell\n\n\n\n\nWG\n\nwater‐dispersible granule\n\n\n\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n"

        "summary": "The conclusions of the European Food Safety Authority ( ) following the peer review of the initial risk assessments carried out by the competent authority of the rapporteur Member State, Austria, for the pesticide active substance 24‐epibrassinolide and the considerations as regards the inclusion of the substance in Annex   of Regulation ( ) No 396/2005 are reported. The context of the peer review was that required by Regulation ( ) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The conclusions were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of 24‐epibrassinolide as an elicitor on grapes, leafy vegetables, sugar beet and as plant activator on grapes and cucurbits. The reliable endpoints, appropriate for use in regulatory risk assessment are presented. Missing information identified as being required by the regulatory framework is listed. No concerns are identified.",
        "full-text": "24‐epibrassinolide is a new active substance for which, in accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the rapporteur Member State (RMS), Austria, received an application from Suntton GmbH on 28 April 2017 for approval. In addition, the applicant submitted an application for inclusion of the substance in Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. Complying with Article 9 of the Regulation, the completeness of the dossier was checked by the RMS and the date of admissibility of the application was recognised as being 30 May 2017.An initial evaluation of the dossier on 24‐epibrassinolide was provided by the RMS in the draft assessment report (DAR) and subsequently, a peer review of the pesticide risk assessment on the RMS evaluation was conducted by EFSA in accordance with Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. The following conclusions are derived.The uses of 24‐epibrassinolide according to the representative uses as an elicitor on grapes, leafy vegetables and sugar beet result in a sufficient efficacy. On the other hand, it was concluded that the use as a plant activator on leafy vegetables and cucurbits is not supported by the efficacy data provided.The assessment of the data package revealed no issues that could not be finalised or that need to be included as critical areas of concern with respect to identity, physical/chemical properties and analytical methods and in the mammalian toxicology section.In the section on residues, the available information on uptake, metabolism and degradation of 24‐epibrassinolide is sufficient and does not indicate the formation of compounds of potential concern for consumers. Toxicological reference values for dietary risk assessment were not allocated, and therefore, a quantitative consumer risk assessment was not considered necessary. No critical areas of concern or issues that could not be finalised were identified.An maximum residue level (MRL) application for inclusion of 24‐epibrassinolide into Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 was submitted. It is proposed to include 24‐epibrassinolide into Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.The data available on environmental fate and behaviour are sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level for the representative uses.The assessment of the data package revealed no issues that could not be finalised or that need to be included as critical areas of concern with respect to ecotoxicology.24‐epibrassinolide does not meet the criteria for endocrine disruption for humans and non‐target organisms as set out in points 3.6.5 and 3.8.2 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) 2018/605.Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council1 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Regulation’) lays down, inter alia, the detailed rules as regards the procedure and conditions for approval of active substances. This regulates for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) the procedure for organising the consultation of Member States and the applicant(s) for comments on the initial evaluation in the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the rapporteur Member State (RMS), and the organisation of an expert consultation, where appropriate.In accordance with Article 12 of the Regulation, EFSA is required to adopt a conclusion on whether an active substance can be expected to meet the approval criteria provided for in Article 4 of the Regulation (also taking into consideration recital (10) of the Regulation) within 120 days from the end of the period provided for the submission of written comments, subject to an extension of 30 days where an expert consultation is necessary, and a further extension of up to 150 days where additional information is required to be submitted by the applicant(s) in accordance with Article 12(3).24‐epibrassinolide is a new active substance for which, in accordance with Article 7 of the Regulation, the RMS, Austria (hereinafter referred to as the ‘RMS’), received an application from Suntton GmbH on 28 April 2017 for approval of the active substance 24‐epibrassinolide. In addition, the applicant submitted an application for inclusion of the substance in Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/20052. Complying with Article 9 of the Regulation, the completeness of the dossier was checked by the RMS and the date of admissibility of the application was recognised as being 30 May 2017.The RMS provided its initial evaluation of the dossier on 24‐epibrassinolide in the DAR, which was received by EFSA on 06 June 2018 (Austria, 2018). The peer review was initiated on 16 January 2019 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant, Suntton GmbH for consultation and comments. EFSA also provided comments. In addition, EFSA conducted a public consultation on the DAR. The comments received were collated by EFSA and forwarded to the RMS for compilation and evaluation in the format of a reporting table. The applicant was invited to respond to the comments in column 3 of the reporting table. The comments and the applicant response were evaluated by the RMS in column 3.The need for expert consultation and the necessity for additional information to be submitted by the applicant in accordance with Article 12(3) of the Regulation were considered in a telephone conference between EFSA and the RMS on 14 May 2019. On the basis of the comments received, the applicant's response to the comments and the RMS's evaluation thereof, it was concluded that additional information should be requested from the applicant and that EFSA should conduct an expert consultation in the areas of mammalian toxicology and environmental fate and behaviour.The outcome of the telephone conference, together with EFSA's further consideration of the comments is reflected in the conclusions set out in column 4 of the reporting table. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase and which required further consideration, including those issues to be considered in an expert consultation, were compiled by EFSA in the format of an evaluation table.The conclusions arising from the consideration by EFSA, and as appropriate by the RMS, of the points identified in the evaluation table, together with the outcome of the expert consultation where this took place, were reported in the final column of the evaluation table.In accordance with Article 12 of the Regulation, EFSA should adopt a conclusion on whether 24‐epibrassinolide can be expected to meet the approval criteria provided for in Article 4 of the Regulation, taking into consideration recital (10) of the Regulation.A final consultation on the conclusions arising from the peer review of the risk assessment and on the proposal for inclusion of the substance in Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 took place with Member States via a written procedure in April 2020.This conclusion report summarises the outcome of the peer review of the risk assessment on the active substance and the representative formulation evaluated on the basis of the representative uses of 24‐epibrassinolide as an elicitor on grapes, leafy vegetables, sugar beet and as plant activator on leafy vegetables and cucurbits, as proposed by the applicant. In accordance with Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, risk mitigation options identified in the DAR and considered during the peer review are presented in the conclusion.Furthermore, this conclusion also addresses the requirement for an assessment by EFSA under Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, provided that the active substance will be approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 without restrictions affecting the residue assessment. In the event of a non‐approval of the active substance or an approval with restrictions that have an impact on the residue assessment, the Annex IV proposal, if any, from this conclusion might no longer be relevant and a new assessment under Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 will be required.A list of the relevant end points for the active substance and the formulation is provided in Appendix A.In addition, a key supporting document to this conclusion is the peer review report (EFSA, 2020), which is a compilation of the documentation developed to evaluate and address all issues raised in the peer review, from the initial commenting phase to the conclusion. The peer review report comprises the following documents, in which all views expressed during the course of the peer review, including minority views where applicable, can be found:\n\nthe comments received on the DAR;\nthe reporting table (9 April 2019);\nthe evaluation table (29 April 2020);\nthe report(s) of the scientific consultation with Member State experts (where relevant);\nthe comments received on the assessment of the additional information (where relevant);\nthe comments received on the draft EFSA conclusion.\nGiven the importance of the DAR including its revisions (Austria, 2020) and the peer review report, both documents are considered as background documents to this conclusion.It is recommended that this conclusion and its background documents would not be accepted to support any registration outside the EU for which the applicant has not demonstrated that it has regulatory access to the information on which this conclusion report is based.24‐epibrassinolide is the common name (no ISO) for (3aS,5R,6S,7aR,7bS,9aS,10R,12aS,12bS)‐10‐((2S,3R,4R,5R)‐3,4‐dihydroxy‐5,6‐dimethylheptan‐2‐yl)‐5,6‐dihydroxy‐7a,9a‐dimethylhexadecahydro‐3H‐benzo[c]indeno[5,4‐e]oxepin‐3‐one (IUPAC).The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ‘Sunergist’, a soluble liquid (SL) containing 0.1 g/L 24‐epibrassinolide.The representative uses evaluated were spray application as an elicitor of plant's self‐defence mechanisms against fungal diseases on wine and table grapes, leafy vegetables (e.g. lettuce) and sugar beet and as a plant activator to protect plants against abiotic stresses in wine and table grapes and cucurbits. Greenhouse applications on leafy vegetables and cucurbits include permanent and non‐permanent structures. Full details of the good agricultural practices (GAPs) can be found in the list of end points in Appendix A.Data were submitted to conclude that the use of 24‐epibrassinolide according to the representative uses proposed at EU level results in a sufficient elicitor efficacy following the guidance document SANCO/10054/2013 ‐ rev. 3 (European Commission, 2013). It was concluded that the use as a plant activator is not supported by the efficacy data provided (data gap).The following guidance documents were followed in the production of this conclusion: European Commission (2000a,b, 2010).The proposed specification for 24‐epibrassinolide is based on batch data from industrial scale production. The proposed minimum purity of the technical material is 900 g/kg. The batches used in the (eco)toxicological assessment support the proposed reference specification (see Sections 2 and 5). There is no FAO specification available for 24‐epibrassinolide.The main data regarding the identity of 24‐epibrassinolide and its physical and chemical properties are reported in Appendix A.Adequate methods are available for the generation of data required for the risk assessment. Methods of analysis are available for the determination of the active substance in the technical material and in the representative formulations and the impurities in the technical material.No monitoring methods were needed since MRLs in food/feed of plant origin and animal products were not set. Methods for monitoring in air and for biomonitoring in body fluids and tissues were also considered not needed. Residue definition for monitoring in soil and water was set as 24‐epibrassinolide, and as a consequence a data gap for monitoring methods in these two compartments was set.24‐epibrassinolide was discussed in the Pesticides Peer Review Meeting 18 in October 2019.Available toxicity studies indicated that 24‐epibrassinolide is poorly absorbed by the oral route and it is of low acute toxicity by the oral, dermal and inhalation routes to rats. It is not a skin sensitiser and it is not an irritant to the skin or eyes. 24‐epibrassinolide is unlikely to be genotoxic. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in the 90‐day rat study is 300 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day based on decreased body weight and food consumption at 1,000 mg/kg bw per day. The developmental and maternal NOAEL in the rat developmental toxicity study is 1,000 mg/kg bw per day (the highest dose level tested). The batches used in toxicity studies were in line with the technical specification and relevant impurities were not identified.24‐epibrassinolide is considered similar to the plant sterols used as cholesterol‐lowering substances in food supplements. Their efficacy as cholesterol‐lowering substances in food supplements has been assessed by EFSA NDA Panel (2012). Owning to the nature of the active substance, data waivers for certain toxicological endpoints were accepted. Overall, it is not expected that the use of 24‐epibrassinolide as a plant protection product will pose a risk to human health when compared to the use of similar plant sterols as food supplements.The applicant did not submit further toxicity studies on 24‐epibrassinolide such as reproductive toxicity or carcinogenicity studies. Likewise, data waiving on those endpoints was considered acceptable. Toxicological reference values were not allocated and a quantitative human risk assessment was not deemed necessary.24‐epibrassinolide is a brassinosteroid that is naturally occurring in higher and lower plants and some fungi.According to the available scientific literature, the metabolism of exogenously applied and endogenous 24‐epibrassinolide is similar and includes hydrogenation, hydroxylation, esterification and glycosylation steps. However, a uniform metabolism pathway cannot be established, and the pattern of compounds formed and the degradation time of 24‐epibrassinolide can vary depending on the plant species, plant organ and the developmental stage. In addition, it is known that brassinosteroids are metabolised by some microorganisms into their corresponding 12β‐hydroxylated brassinosteroid compounds.In tests in wheat and cucumber, 14C‐24‐epibrassinolide was readily taken up and swiftly transported throughout plants when applied to the roots, while transport was generally very slow or not observed when 14C‐24‐epibrassinolide was applied to leaves. However, a difference in the metabolism steps and the resulting metabolites is not expected. The concentration of brassinosteroids in plants is regulated by a complex system of feedback pathways and brassinosteroids are constantly synthesised, metabolised, activated and inactivated depending on the plant's needs as well as environmental cues. Consideration of uptake and fate of exogenously applied 24‐epibrassinolide by plants via their roots was triggered by the DT90 of 24‐epibrassinolide in soil (see Section 4) and could be addressed by the available information.Altogether, the available information on uptake, metabolism and degradation of 24‐epibrassinolide is sufficient and does not indicate the formation of compounds with the potential for concern to consumers.Application rates of 24‐epibrassinolide in crops are very low (less than 1 g/ha) and a calculation of hypothetical residues showed that for all representative uses, the possible residues would be well below 0.01 mg/kg and the natural endogenous brassinosteroid content in plant tissues.Toxicological reference values for dietary risk assessment were not allocated (see Section 2), and a quantitative consumer risk assessment was considered unnecessary.It is proposed to include 24‐epibrassinolide into Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 since the inclusion criteria according to guidance document European Commission, 2015 are met.24‐epibrassinolide was discussed in the Pesticides Peer Review Meeting 19 in October 2019.Brassinosteroids, including 24‐epibrassinolide, are naturally occurring and ubiquitous plant constituents. Information on the natural existence of the substance in the environment and on the possible route and rate of degradation were found in the published scientific literature. Due to the natural occurrence of 24‐epibrassinolide in plant tissues, exposure assessment for metabolites was considered unnecessary as the levels of active substance being applied were considered to be covered by the naturally present levels of brassinosteroids in terrestrial and aquatic plant organs, including leaves, that following the normal plant growth cycles reach soil and are naturally present in aquatic systems.Although not much is known on the exact degradation pathway of brassinosteroids in soil, it is considered that the degradation pathway for synthesised 24‐epibrassinolide will be the same as for the natural sources. Furthermore, as only low amounts of the synthesised molecule are proposed to be applied, the artificial release will only influence natural background levels to a limited extend.In soil laboratory incubations from the public literature, 24‐epibrassinolide exhibited moderate to medium persistence. Though the DT50 in soil triggered soil dissipation studies, these were considered not needed based on the ubiquitous presence of brassinosteroids in the soil environment consequent to their natural addition from decaying plant organs such as leaves and subsequent decomposition.Experimental studies were not available for the determination of the mobility of 24‐epibrassionolide in soil. However, quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) estimations of the adsorption of 24‐epibrassinolide were performed with KocWin 2.01. Two methods were used (MCI and Kow), resulting in the estimation of two different values. These values would indicate that 24‐epibrassionolide might exhibit very high mobility or be immobile in soil. For the exposure assessment, it was decided to use the worst case of the two available estimated values depending on the environmental compartment investigated.Degradation rates in natural sediment water systems could not be derived from the available scientific literature so the degradation rate resulting from a sterile hydrolysis experiment at pH 7 following normalisation to 20°C was used for the surface water and sediment exposure assessment.The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments (Predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) calculations) were carried out for 24‐epibrassinolide, using the FOCUS (FOCUS, 2001) step 1 and step 2 approach (version 3.2 of the Steps 1–2 in FOCUS calculator). The surface water and sediment exposure assessments for the representative protected uses were considered covered by the available calculations for the field uses.The necessary groundwater exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using FOCUS (European Commission, 2014) scenarios and the models PEARL 4.4.4, PELMO 5.5.3 and MACRO 5.5.4.3 The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative uses by 24‐epibrassinolide above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 μg/L (that might be applicable should managers consider that 24‐epibrassinolide acts as a fungicide) was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all nine FOCUS groundwater scenarios.As PEC in groundwater and surface water for 24‐epibrassinolide were calculated to be below 0.1 μg/L for the representative uses assessed and transformation products were assessed as being lower than natural background levels, residues that might be present in surface water and groundwater, when surface water or groundwater is abstracted for drinking water were considered too low to trigger the need to assess the effect of drinking water treatment processes on raw water residues.The PEC in soil, surface water, sediment and groundwater covering the representative uses assessed can be found in Appendix A of this conclusion.The risk assessment was based on the following documents: European Commission (2002), SETAC (2001), EFSA (2009), EFSA PPR Panel (2013) and EFSA (2013).Toxicity data were not available for birds. Acute and long‐term toxicity data (90‐day chronic oral toxicity study) were available for the active substance, 24‐epibrassinolide, for mammals. Furthermore, an acute toxicity study with mammals was also available for the representative product, Sunergist. As toxicity data were not available for birds, a quantitative risk assessment could not be performed. Instead a weight‐of‐evidence assessment was performed which accounted for the natural occurrence of brassinosteroids in the diet of birds (and mammals) and an illustrative risk assessment assuming that the substance is 10 times more toxic to birds than mammals (which resulted in a high margin of safety being indicated). The available acute risk assessment for mammals indicated a low risk for all representative uses. A risk assessment was also presented using the endpoint from the available 90‐day chronic oral toxicity study. This type of endpoint does not account for reproductive effects and therefore is not normally selected for risk assessment. Nevertheless, a low long‐term (including reproductive effects) was concluded given that brassinosteroids naturally occur in the diet of mammals. A low risk to birds and mammals was also concluded for secondary poisoning and for intake via contaminated water.Acute toxicity data were available for fish and aquatic invertebrates. Toxicity data were not available for algae or aquatic plants. Furthermore, chronic toxicity data were not available. Based on the available quantitative risk assessment, a low acute risk was concluded for fish and aquatic invertebrates for all representative uses. Owing to the lack of toxicity data, a quantitative chronic risk assessment for algae and aquatic plants was not available. Nevertheless, a low risk was concluded given that the application of 24‐epibrassinolide, according to the representative use, is not likely to increase the natural background level of brassinosteroids.Acute contact and oral toxicity data for honey bees were available. Data were not available for the chronic oral toxicity to honey bees, toxicity to honey bee larvae, sublethal effects to honey bees or accumulated effects to honey bees. Furthermore, toxicity data were not available for bumble bees or solitary bees.Acute risk assessments, in accordance with both European Commission (2002) and EFSA (2013), were available. Both risk assessments indicated a low acute contact and oral risk to honeybees with a high margin of safety. Owing to the lack of toxicity data, a quantitative risk assessment could not be performed to cover the chronic risk to honeybees, risk to honeybee larvae or risk from sublethal effects. However, a low risk to bees was concluded based on a weight‐of‐evidence assessment which considered the natural background concentrations of brassinosteroids in plants and pollen and information from the scientific literature.Tier 1 toxicity studies with the two standard species of non‐target arthropods were available. A low risk to non‐target arthropods was concluded based on the available tier 1 risk assessment.Toxicity studies were not available for earthworms, other soil macroorganisms and soil microorganisms. Consequently, a quantitative risk assessment for soil organisms was not available. However, as discussed in Section 4, the representative use of 24‐epibrassinolide is not likely to result in soil concentrations which are greater than the background level of brassinosteroids. Consequently, a low risk to earthworms, other soil macroorganisms and soil microorganisms was concluded.Toxicity studies with non‐target terrestrial plants were not available, so a quantitative risk assessment could not be carried out. It is stated that 24‐epibrassinolide acts by activating and enhancing the defence and immune system of plants which would infer that no adverse effects on non‐target plants are anticipated. Furthermore, literature information was provided which indicated that brassinosteroids, including 24‐epibrassinolide, are naturally occurring plant growth promoting molecules found in plant tissues. Other studies indicated that exposure to brassinosteroids results in higher crop yield. Consequently, accounting for the available weight‐of‐evidence, a low risk to non‐target terrestrial plants was concluded.For the representative uses, a low risk to organisms involved in biological sewage treatment processes was concluded.An assessment of the endocrine‐disrupting properties of 24‐epibrassinolide was discussed at the Peer Review Experts’ meeting PREV 22 (January 2020).24‐Epibrassinolide is a plant hormone belonging to the brassinosteroid class of compounds and it is considered similar to the plant sterols used as cholesterol‐lowering substances in food supplements.Regarding human health, a complete data package according to data requirements is not available for 24‐epibrassinolide. However, the overall weight of evidence indicates that based on lack of any estrogen, androgen, thyroid, steroidogenesis (EATS) mediated adverse effect in the available data set, the expected low absorption of the substance and the similarity with plant sterols for which the absence of endocrine effects via the oral route was concluded (SCF, 2000) an assessment of endocrine‐disrupting properties for human health in line with ECHA/EFSA Guidance (2018) did not appear necessary from a scientific point of view. This conclusion is further supported by an exposure through the representative uses is not expected to impact on the overall human exposure to naturally occurring brassinosteroids.Likewise, for non‐target organisms, an assessment of the endocrine properties in line with ECHA and EFSA (2018) was not available. However, the use of 24‐epibrassinolide is not considered to increase the natural exposure of non‐target organisms to brassinosteroids, based on the natural occurrence of brassinosteroids in environment considering the low application rate of 24‐epibrassinolide according to the representative uses assessed. Additionally, there is no evidence in the literature that brassinosteroids may lead endocrine‐mediated adversity in non‐target organisms. Therefore, an assessment of endocrine‐disrupting properties for non‐target organisms in line with ECHA and EFSA (2018) did not appear necessary from a scientific point of view.Considering the above, it can be concluded that 24‐epibrassinolide does not to meet the criteria for endocrine disruption for humans and non‐target organisms according to points 3.6.5 and 3.8.2 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) 2018/6054.This is a list of data gaps identified during the peer review process, including those areas in which a study may have been made available during the peer review process but not considered for procedural reasons (without prejudice to the provisions of Article 56 of the Regulation concerning information on potentially harmful effects).\n\nAdditional efficacy studies (relevant for plant activator use in wine and table grapes and cucurbits; see Section 1).\nAnalytical methods for monitoring of 24‐epibrassinolide in soil and water (relevant for all representative uses evaluated; see Section 1).\nNo particular conditions are proposed for the representative uses evaluated.\n\n\n\n\n1/n\n\nslope of Freundlich isotherm\n\n\n\n\nλ\n\nwavelength\n\n\n\n\nε\n\ndecadic molar extinction coefficient\n\n\n\n\nbw\n\nbody weight\n\n\n\n\nDAR\n\ndraft assessment report\n\n\n\n\nDT50\n\nperiod required for 50% dissipation (define method of estimation)\n\n\n\n\nDT90\n\nperiod required for 90% dissipation (define method of estimation)\n\n\n\n\nECHA\n\nEuropean Chemicals Agency\n\n\n\n\nFAO\n\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n\n\n\n\nFIR\n\nfood intake rate\n\n\n\n\nFOB\n\nfunctional observation battery\n\n\n\n\nFOCUS\n\nForum for the Co‐ordination of Pesticide Fate Models and their Use\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nGM\n\ngeometric mean\n\n\n\n\nGS\n\ngrowth stage\n\n\n\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organization for Standardization\n\n\n\n\nIUPAC\n\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n\n\n\n\niv\n\nintravenous\n\n\n\n\nKFoc\n\nFreundlich organic carbon adsorption coefficient\n\n\n\n\nMCI\n\nmolecular connectivity indices\n\n\n\n\nmm\n\nmillimetre (also used for mean measured concentrations)\n\n\n\n\nmN\n\nmilli‐newton\n\n\n\n\nMOA\n\nmode of action\n\n\n\n\nMRL\n\nmaximum residue level\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nmass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nMWHC\n\nmaximum water‐holding capacity\n\n\n\n\nNOAEL\n\nno observed adverse effect level\n\n\n\n\nPa\n\npascal\n\n\n\n\nPD\n\nproportion of different food types\n\n\n\n\nPEC\n\npredicted environmental concentration\n\n\n\n\nPECair\n\npredicted environmental concentration in air\n\n\n\n\nPECgw\n\npredicted environmental concentration in groundwater\n\n\n\n\nPECsed\n\npredicted environmental concentration in sediment\n\n\n\n\nPECsoil\n\npredicted environmental concentration in soil\n\n\n\n\nPECsw\n\npredicted environmental concentration in surface water\n\n\n\n\npKa\n\nnegative logarithm (to the base 10) of the dissociation constant\n\n\n\n\nPow\n\npartition coefficient between n‐octanol and water\n\n\n\n\nppm\n\nparts per million (10−6)\n\n\n\n\nQSAR\n\nquantitative structure–activity relationship\n\n\n\n\nSC\n\nsuspension concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSD\n\nstandard deviation\n\n\n\n\nSL\n\nsoluble liquid\n\n\n\n\nSMILES\n\nsimplified molecular‐input line‐entry system\n\n\n\n\nt1/2\n\nhalf‐life (define method of estimation)\n\n\n\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n"

        "full-text": "In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, ISK Biosciences Europe N.V. submitted an application to the competent national authority in Finland (evaluating Member State, EMS) to set import tolerances for the active substance flonicamid in various crops and products of animal origin on the basis of authorised use of flonicamid in the USA. The EMS drafted an evaluation report in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on 11 December 2019. The EMS proposed to raise MRLs for almonds, potatoes, beans and peas (with and without pods), pulses and hops; the EMS did not propose to modify the existing MRLs for other tree nuts (except almonds), basil and edible flowers as well as for the commodities of animal origin.EFSA assessed the application and the evaluation report as required by Article 10 of the MRL regulation. Based on the conclusions derived by EFSA in the framework of Directive 91/414/EEC, the data evaluated under previous MRL assessments, including the MRL review according to Article 12 of the Regulation (EU) 396/2005 (MRL review) and the additional data provided by the EMS in the framework of this application, the following conclusions are derived.The metabolism of flonicamid has been investigated in fruit (peach, pepper), root (potato) and cereals/grass (wheat) crop groups. Parent flonicamid and the two metabolites 4‐trifluoromethylnicotinic acid (TFNA) and N‐(4‐trifluoromethylnicotinoyl) glycine (TFNG) were found to be the main residues. Studies investigating the effect of processing on the nature of flonicamid (hydrolysis studies) demonstrated that the active substance and its metabolites are hydrolytically stable under the representative conditions.As the authorised uses of flonicamid are on imported crops, investigations of residues in rotational crops are not required.Based on the metabolic pattern identified in metabolism studies, the results of hydrolysis studies, the toxicological significance of metabolites and degradation products, the residue definition for plant products was proposed as ‘sum of flonicamid, TFNA and TFNG, expressed as flonicamid’ for enforcement and risk assessment. This residue definition is applicable to primary crops, rotational crops and processed products.EFSA concluded that for the crops assessed in the present application, the metabolism of flonicamid in primary crops and the possible degradation in processed products has been sufficiently addressed and that the previously derived residue definitions are applicable.Sufficiently validated analytical methods based on high‐performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC‐MS/MS) are available to quantify residues in the crops assessed in this application according to the enforcement residue definition. The methods allow quantifying residues for each analyte included in the residue definition at the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.01 mg/kg (combined LOQ of 0.03 mg/kg) for high water, high acid, high oil, dry commodities and fresh hops and at the LOQ of 0.05 mg/kg (combined LOQ of 0.15 mg/kg) for dried hops.The available residue trials are sufficient to derive MRL proposals for tree nuts (except coconuts), potatoes, beans (with and without pods), peas (with and without pods), pulses and hops. For basil and edible flowers (covering mint), the trials were also sufficient but did not suggest the modification of the MRL in place.The processing factors (PF) derived for potato chips and potato flakes from the studies submitted under current assessment were not robust enough to be included in Annex VI of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.Among the crops under assessment, potatoes and pulses may be used for feed purposes. Since import of these commodities in Europe is applied for, these crops or their by‐products can enter the EU livestock feed chain. Thus, a potential carry‐over of flonicamid residues into food of animal origin was assessed. The calculated EU livestock dietary burden exceeded the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg dry matter (DM) for all relevant animal species, but the calculated exposure was significantly lower than the livestock exposure calculated by the JMPR, based on which the existing EU MRLs for flonicamid in commodities of animal origin were recently set.The toxicological profile of flonicamid was assessed in the framework of the EU pesticides peer review under Directive 91/414/EEC and the data were sufficient to derive an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0.025 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day and an acute reference dose (ARfD) of 0.025 mg/kg bw. The metabolites included in the residue definition are of similar toxicity as the parent active substance.The consumer risk assessment was performed with revision 3.1 of the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo). The short‐term exposure assessment was performed only with regard to the commodities assessed in the present MRL application in accordance with the internationally agreed methodology. The short‐term exposure was below the ARfD for all commodities and accounted the highest for peas (without pods) (96% of ARfD), beans (without pods) (93% of ARfD), potatoes (68% of ARfD), peas (with pods) (66% of ARfD) and beans (with pods) (64% of ARfD).The long‐term exposure assessment performed in the most recent EFSA reasoned opinion published after the MRL review was updated with the risk assessment values derived from the residue trials submitted in support of the present MRL application. The highest estimated long‐term dietary intake was 30% of the ADI (NL toddler). The contribution of residues of flonicamid in the crops under consideration to the overall long‐term exposure was individually less than 3% of ADI.Based on the consumer exposure assessment, EFSA concludes that the authorised USA uses of flonicamid will not result in acute or chronic consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and, therefore, is unlikely to pose a risk to consumers’ health.EFSA proposes to amend the existing MRLs as reported in the summary table below.Full details of all endpoints and the consumer risk assessment can be found in Appendices B–D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodea\n\nCommodity\n\nExisting\nEU MRL\n(mg/kg)\n\n\nProposed\nEU MRL\n(mg/kg)\n\nComment/justification\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforcement residue definition (plant commodities): Flonicamid (sum of flonicamid, TFNA and TFNG, expressed as flonicamid)\n\n\n0120000\nTree nuts (except coconuts and pistachios)\n0.06*\n\n0.07\nThe submitted data are sufficient to derive an import tolerance based on the authorised US GAP.

When re‐viewing the MRL, the Commission will take into account the information referred to in the first sentence, if it is submitted by 27 January 2018, or, if that information is not submitted by that date, the lack of it.\n\n\n\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) received an application to modify the existing maximum residue level (MRL) for flonicamid in various crops and products of animal origin. The detailed description of the authorised uses of flonicamid in the USA, which are the basis for the current MRL application, is reported in Appendix A.Flonicamid is the ISO common name for N‐cyanomethyl‐4‐(trifluoromethyl)nicotinamide (IUPAC). The chemical structures of the active substance and its main metabolites are reported in Appendix E.Flonicamid was evaluated in the framework of Directive 91/414/EEC1 with France designated as rapporteur Member State (RMS) for the representative uses as foliar spray applications on potatoes, wheat, apples and pears in northern and southern European Union (EU) and on peaches in the southern EU. The draft assessment report (DAR) prepared by the RMS has been peer reviewed by EFSA (2010). Flonicamid was approved2 for the use as insecticide on 1 September 2010.The EU MRLs for flonicamid are established in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 396/20053. The review of existing MRLs according to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 (MRL review) has been performed (EFSA, 2014) and the proposed modifications have been implemented in the MRL legislation. After completion of the MRL review, EFSA has issued several reasoned opinions on the modification of MRLs for flonicamid (EFSA, 2015, 2016a, 2017, 2018b,c, 2019b, 2020). Proposals from these reasoned opinions have been considered in recent MRL regulations.4 Certain Codex maximum residue limits (CXLs) have been taken over in the EU MRL legislation.5In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, ISK Biosciences Europe N.V. submitted an application to the competent national authority in Finland (evaluating Member State, EMS) to set import tolerances for the active substance flonicamid in various crops and products of animal origin. The EMS drafted an evaluation report in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to the EFSA on 11 December 2019. The EMS proposed to raise MRLs for almonds, potatoes, beans and peas (with and without pods), pulses and hops; the EMS did not propose to modify the existing MRLs for other tree nuts (except almonds), basil and edible flowers as well as for the commodities of animal origin.EFSA based its assessment on the evaluation report submitted by the EMS (Finland, 2019), the draft assessment report (DAR) (and its addendum) (France, 2005, 2009) prepared under Council Directive 91/414/EEC, the Commission review report on flonicamid (European Commission, 2010a), the conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance flonicamid (EFSA, 2010), as well as the conclusions from previous EFSA opinions on flonicamid (EFSA, 2015, 2016a,b, 2017, 2018b,c, 2019b, 2020).For this application, the data requirements established in Regulation (EU) No 544/20116 and the guidance documents applicable at the date of submission of the application to the EMS are applicable (European Commission, 1997a–g, 2000, 2010b,c, 2017; OECD, 2011, 2013). The assessment is performed in accordance with the legal provisions of the Uniform Principles for the Evaluation and the Authorisation of Plant Protection Products adopted by Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/20117.A selected list of end points of the studies assessed by EFSA in the framework of this MRL application including the end points of relevant studies assessed previously is presented in Appendix B.The evaluation report submitted by the EMS (Finland, 2019) and the exposure calculations using the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) are considered as supporting documents to this reasoned opinion and, thus, are made publicly available as background documents to this reasoned opinion.Among the crops under assessment, potatoes and pulses may be used for feed purposes. Since import of these commodities in Europe is applied for, these crops or their by‐products can enter the EU livestock feed chain. Hence, it was necessary to update the previous dietary burden calculation for livestock to estimate whether the residues of flonicamid in imported potatoes and pulses and their by‐products would have an impact on the levels of residues expected in food of animal origin (EFSA, 2018c).In the framework of the present assessment, the applicant applied for MRLs in commodities of animal origin, which are lower than the existing EU MRLs for flonicamid. This may be explained by the fact that the current application (2018) was submitted in parallel with the publication of Regulation (EU) 2018/68713, implementing higher Codex MRLs for flonicamid in animal commodities (EFSA, 2016b).The input values for the exposure calculations for livestock are presented in Appendix D.1.The results of the dietary burden calculation presented in Appendix B.2. showed that the exposure to flonicamid residues exceeds the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg DM in all species. However, the calculated dietary burdens are significantly lower than the dietary burdens calculated for Australian cattle and EU poultry by the JMPR (FAO, 2016b), based on which the existing EU MRLs are currently set. Nevertheless, the nature and magnitude of flonicamid residues in livestock were assessed further.EFSA performed a dietary risk assessment for the agreed residue definitions for risk assessment using revision 3.1 of the EFSA PRIMo (EFSA, 2018a, 2019a). This exposure assessment model contains food consumption data for different subgroups of the EU population and allows the acute and chronic exposure assessment to be performed in accordance with the internationally agreed methodology for pesticide residues (FAO, 2016a).The toxicological reference values for flonicamid used in the risk assessment (i.e. ADI and ARfD values) were derived in the framework of the EU pesticides peer review (EFSA, 2010). The metabolites included in the risk assessment residue definition were considered to be of similar toxicity as the parent compound.The input values used in the exposure calculations are summarised in Appendix D.2.\nShort‐term (acute) dietary risk assessment\nThe short‐term risk assessment was performed only with regard to the commodities assessed in the present MRL application: tree nuts (except coconuts), potatoes, basil and edible flowers, beans (with and without pods), peas (with and without pods), beans (dry), peas (dry) and hops. The estimation of the exposure is based on the highest residue (HR) derived from the supervised field trials submitted on the above‐mentioned commodities.For the crops under assessment, the short‐term exposure did not exceed the ARfD and accounted for peas (without pods) (96% of ARfD), beans (without pods) (93% of ARfD), potatoes (68% of ARfD), peas (with pods) (66% of ARfD), beans (with pods) (64%), beans (dry) (29% of ARfD), peas (dry) (10% of ARfD), basil and edible flowers (8% of ARfD), pistachios (4% of ARfD), hops (2% of ARfD) and tree nuts (except pistachios and coconuts) (≤ 1% of ARfD).\nLong‐term (chronic) dietary risk assessment\nIn the framework of the MRL review, a comprehensive long‐term exposure assessment was performed, taking into account the existing uses at EU level and the acceptable CXLs (EFSA, 2014). EFSA updated the calculation with the relevant STMR values derived from the residue trials submitted in support of this MRL application for the above‐mentioned crops and products of animal origin (Finland, 2019). STMRs derived in EFSA opinions published after the MRL review (EFSA, 2015, 2016a,b, 2017, 2018b,c, 2019b, 2020) were also considered in the estimation of the long‐term exposure. The contributions of commodities for which no GAP was reported in the framework of the MRL review (EFSA, 2014) and in subsequent EFSA flonicamid assessments were not included in the calculation.The estimated long‐term exposure to flonicamid residues accounted for up to 30% of the ADI (NL toddler). The contribution of residues expected in (i) beans (with pods) is up to the 2.8% of the ADI, (ii) potatoes is up to the 1.3% of the ADI, (iii) peas (without pods) is up to the 1.3% of the ADI, (iv) beans (dry) is up to the 1.2% of the ADI and (v) for all other assessed crops is less than 1% of the ADI.Based on the consumer exposure assessment, EFSA concludes that the existing EU uses and the authorised uses of flonicamid in the USA will not result in acute or chronic consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a risk to consumers’ health.For further details on the exposure calculations, a screenshot of the Report sheet of the PRIMo is presented in Appendix C.The data submitted in support of this MRL application were found to be sufficient to derive MRL proposals for all crops under assessment on the basis of authorised uses of flonicamid in the USA.The livestock exposure to flonicamid residues from the intake of potatoes and pulses treated according to authorised uses would not require modification of the existing EU MRLs for flonicamid in commodities of animal origin.EFSA updated the most recent consumer risk assessment for flonicamid and concluded that the authorised USA uses of flonicamid will not result in acute or chronic consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and, therefore, is unlikely to pose a risk to consumers’ health.The MRL recommendations are summarised in Appendix B.4.\n\n\n\n\na.s.\n\nactive substance\n\n\n\n\nADI\n\nacceptable daily intake\n\n\n\n\nAR\n\napplied radioactivity\n\n\n\n\nARfD\n\nacute reference dose\n\n\n\n\nBBCH\n\ngrowth stages of mono‐ and dicotyledonous plants\n\n\n\n\nbw\n\nbody weight\n\n\n\n\nCAS\n\nChemical Abstract Service\n\n\n\n\nCCPR\n\nCodex Committee on Pesticide Residues\n\n\n\n\nCF\n\nconversion factor for enforcement to risk assessment residue definition\n\n\n\n\nCIRCA\n\n(EU) Communication & Information Resource Centre Administrator\n\n\n\n\nCS\n\ncapsule suspension\n\n\n\n\nCV\n\ncoefficient of variation (relative standard deviation)\n\n\n\nDAR\ndraft assessment report \n\n\n\nDAT\n\ndays after treatment\n\n\n\n\nDM\n\ndry matter\n\n\n\n\nDS\n\npowder for dry seed treatment\n\n\n\n\nDT90\n\nperiod required for 90 % dissipation (define method of estimation)\n\n\n\n\nEC\n\nemulsifiable concentrate\n\n\n\n\nEDI\n\nestimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nEMS\n\nevaluating Member State\n\n\n\n\nFAO\n\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nGS\n\ngrowth stage\n\n\n\n\nHPLC\n\nhigh‐performance liquid chromatography\n\n\n\n\nHPLC‐MS\n\nhigh‐performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nHPLC‐MS/MS\n\nhigh‐performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nHR\n\nhighest residue\n\n\n\n\nIEDI\n\ninternational estimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nIESTI\n\ninternational estimated short‐term intake\n\n\n\n\nILV\n\nindependent laboratory validation\n\n\n\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organisation for Standardisation\n\n\n\n\nIUPAC\n\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n\n\n\n\nJMPR\n\nJoint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues\n\n\n\n\nLC\n\nliquid chromatography\n\n\n\nLOQ\nlimit of quantification \n\n\nMRL\nmaximum residue level \n\n\n\nMS\n\nMember States\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nmass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nMS/MS\n\ntandem mass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nMW\n\nmolecular weight\n\n\n\n\nNEU\n\nnorthern Europe\n\n\n\n\nOECD\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development\n\n\n\n\nPBI\n\nplant back interval\n\n\n\n\nPF\n\nprocessing factor\n\n\n\n\nPHI\n\npreharvest interval\n\n\n\n\nPRIMo\n\n(EFSA) Pesticide Residues Intake Model\n\n\n\n\nRA\n\nrisk assessment\n\n\n\n\nRAC\n\nraw agricultural commodity\n\n\n\n\nRD\n\nresidue definition\n\n\n\n\nRMS\n\nrapporteur Member State\n\n\n\nSANCO\nDirectorate‐General for Health and Consumers \n\n\n\nSC\n\nsuspension concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSEU\n\nsouthern Europe\n\n\n\n\nSG\n\nwater‐soluble granule\n\n\n\n\nSL\n\nsoluble concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSTMR\n\nsupervised trials median residue\n\n\n\n\nUV\n\nultraviolet (detector)\n\n\n\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n\n\nWP\n\nwettable powder\n\n\n"

The  Panel concludes that the additives under consideration are safe for the target species at the following use levels: (i) ginger essential oil up to the maximum proposed use level of 80 mg/kg for veal calves (milk replacer) and 20 mg/kg complete feed (or 20 mg/L water for drinking) for all other species; (ii) ginger oleoresin at the maximum proposed concentrations of 20 mg/kg complete feed for fish, sheep, goats and horses and of 1 mg/kg for pets. For the remaining species, the calculated maximum safe concentration of ginger oleoresin in feed is less than that proposed use level and ranges from 5 mg/kg complete feed for chickens for fattening to 21 mg/kg for veal calves; (iii) ginger tincture at the maximum proposed concentrations of 1.6  /kg complete feed for horses and 0.26  /kg for dogs. For poultry species, the calculated maximum safe dose ranges between 0.2 and 0.3 mg/L water for drinking. No concerns for consumers were identified following the use of the additives up to the highest safe level in animal nutrition. The additives should be considered as irritants to skin and eyes and the respiratory tract and as a skin sensitisers.

As a follow‐up to this assessment, the Panel on Food Additives and Flavourings ( ) was requested to assess the safety of ascorbyl palmitate (E 304(i)) for its uses as food additive in food for infants below 16 weeks of age belonging to food categories 13.1.1 (Infant formulae) and 13.1.5.1 (Dietary foods for infants for special medical purposes and special formulae for infants) and as carry over in line with Annex  , Part 5 Section B to Regulation ( ) No 1333/2008. In addition, the   Panel was requested to address the issues already identified during the re‐evaluation of the food additive when used in food for the general population. The process involved the publication of a call for data to allow the interested business operators to provide the requested information to complete the risk assessment. On the basis of the data submitted by interested business operators and the considerations from the Panel, a revision of the existing   specifications for ascorbyl palmitate (E 304 (i)) has been recommended. Based on in vitro data, the   Panel assumed that ascorbyl palmitate fully hydrolyses pre‐systemically to ascorbic acid and palmitate. The Panel concluded that the intake of both metabolites, at the  s for ascorbyl palmitate as a food additive in infant formula belonging to   13.1.1 or in food for special medical purposes belonging to   13.1.5.1, does not raise health concerns.",
        "full-text": "In accordance with Regulation (EU) No 257/2010, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is currently re‐evaluating the safety of food additives already permitted in the Union before 20 January 2009 and issuing scientific opinions on their safety when used in food as per Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008. The risk assessment approach followed in the re‐evaluation has not covered the use of food additives in food for infants below 12 weeks of age. Additionally, while re‐evaluating the safety of food additives referred to above, EFSA identified some concerns, namely (1) Data gaps that have triggered recommendations in the published scientific opinions; and/or; (2) Data gaps that have increased uncertainties linked to the risk assessment and/or which prevented the Panel from concluding on some aspects of it.On 31 May 2017, EFSA published a guidance on the risk assessment of substances present in food intended for infants below 16 weeks of age, thus enabling EFSA to assess the safety of food additive used in food for infants below this age. The age up to 16 weeks was selected in the guidance because infants are exposed to formula feeding until this age as the only source of food since complementary feeding is not supposed to be introduced before.As follow‐up of the above, this Opinion addresses the data gaps previously identified during the re‐evaluation of ascorbyl palmitate (E 304(i)) as food additive and the safety in the special subpopulation of infants below 16 weeks of age.The process followed involved the publication of a dedicated call for data allowing all interested business operators to provide the requested information for completing the assessment and to confirm that the additive is used as food additive in food categories 13.1.1 (Infant formulae) and 13.1.5.1 (Dietary foods for infants for special medical purposes and special formulae for infants) and present as carry over in line with Annex III, Part 5 Section B to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008. In addition, the interested business operators were requested to provide data to address the issues already identified during the re‐evaluation of the food additive when used in food for the general population. The data submitted in response to the call for data on ascorbyl palmitate (E 304(i)) comprised technical information, human data and the outcome of literature searches.On the basis of the data submitted by interested business operators and the considerations from the Panel, a revision of the existing EU specifications for ascorbyl palmitate (E 304(i)) has been recommended. In particular, the Panel recommended to lower the current maximum limits in the specifications for lead, arsenic and mercury, considering also other sources of exposure, and to include limits for solvents.Dietary exposure to ascorbyl palmitate (E 304(i)) from its use as a food additive was estimated for infants below 16 weeks of age. The exposure scenario is based on the recommended consumption levels from the relevant Scientific Committee Guidance which recommends values of 200 and 260 mL formula/kg body weight (bw) per day as conservative mean and high‐level consumption values for 14–27 days old infants. For infants below 16 weeks of age consuming infant formulae (Food category 13.1.1), the exposure to ascorbyl palmitate (E 304(i)) was estimated to be 2 mg/kg bw per day (mean consumption) and 2.6 mg/kg bw per day (high‐level consumption). For infants below 16 weeks of age consuming infant formula for special medical purposes (FSMP) (Food category 13.1.5.1), the exposure to ascorbyl palmitate (E 304(i)) was estimated to be 20 mg/kg bw per day (mean consumption) and 26 mg/kg bw per day (high‐level consumption).No new animal data were provided. Literature searches were performed by the interested business operators. The literature search identified one paper in which toxicological endpoints (cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis) were studied and which was published after the last evaluation. According to the Panel, this publication does not contribute to the assessment of the safety of ascorbyl palmitate as a food additive.Several clinical studies were submitted in which formulas were tested which contained ascorbyl palmitate among other food additives. None of the studies was intended to test the safety and tolerability of ascorbyl palmitate specifically. In these studies, no remarkable deviations from the normal growth and development were noted. All the studies have limitations in design and reporting. In a risk of bias assessment, five of the six studies were allocated to tier 3 and one study to tier 2 in which the Panel noted that ascorbyl palmitate was present in a relatively low concentration of ■■■■■. The absence of appropriate control groups which were not exposed to ascorbyl‐palmitate is the most severe limitation. Therefore, the studies provide limited evidence for the safe use of ascorbyl palmitate. From the post‐marketing information, it can be deduced that adverse effects were rarely reported.For the current assessment of ascorbyl palmitate, the FAF Panel assumed based on in vitro data that also infants below the age of 16 weeks are able to hydrolyse ascorbyl palmitate pre‐systemically to ascorbic acid and palmitate.Exposure to ascorbyl palmitate (E 304(i)) from infant formulae (FC 13.1.1) was estimated at 2.6 mg/kg bw per day at the 95 percentile which corresponds to 1.11 mg/kg bw per day ascorbic acid. Taking into account the molecular weight of the moiety of ascorbic acid in the additive E 304(i), ascorbic acid corresponds to 42.5% of the weight. EFSA has proposed an adequate vitamin C intake of 20 mg/day for infants up to 6 months. Hence, considering the default body weight of 4.8 kg for infants from 0 to 3 months of age, the amount of vitamin C resulting from the exposure to ascorbyl palmitate (E 304(i)) for the scenario with infant formulae (FC 13.1.1) results to be 26.6% of the adequate vitamin C intake. For the exposure according to the scenario with special infant formulae (FC 13.1.5.1), the exposure to ascorbyl palmitate (E 304(i)) was estimated to be 10‐fold higher than the previous one and thus should be 2.66 fold (i.e. 266%) the adequate vitamin C intake. Compared to the regulatory content of vitamin C in infant formulae of minimum 4 and maximum 30 mg ascorbic acid/100 kcal (Reg (EU) 2016/127), high‐level intake (p95) of ascorbic acid from the use of E 304(i) in infant formulae (FC 13.1.1) represents between 2.0 and 17.7%. Compared to the regulatory content of vitamin C in special infant formulae (i.e. food for special medical purposes developed to satisfy the nutritional requirements of infants) of minimum 4 and maximum 30 mg ascorbic acid/100 kcal (Reg (EU) 2016/128), high‐level intake (p95) of ascorbic acid from the use of E 304(i) in special infant formulae (FC 13.1.5.1) represents between 20 and 177%. The Panel noted that the SCF and the NDA Panel concluded that the available data did not allow to set an upper limit of intake level for vitamin C at any age. Given the fact that adverse effects in adults are only reported with doses of several grams of vitamin C (e.g. 5 g/adult = 71.4 mg/kg bw per day), the Panel considered that the exceedance of the statutory maximum content is of no safety concern.No regulatory guidance currently exists for palmitate intake. The Panel noted that palmitate provides approximately 25% of all breast milk fatty acids and that triglycerides represent 98–99% of breast milk fat content, i.e. 35 g/L. Considering a high daily breast milk intake of 1,200 mL for infants from 0 to 6 months (EFSA NDA Panel, 2013) and the default value of 4.8 kg for infants between 0 and 3 months (EFSA Scientific Committee, 2012), the palmitate intake in an exclusively breast fed infant can be estimated to around 2,200 mg/kg bw per day. Exposure to palmitate from the use of 304(i) in infant formula (FC 13.1.1) and in special infant formulae (FC 13.1.5.1) represents therefore less than, respectively, 0.1% and 1% of palmitate intake in exclusively breastfed infants between 0 and 3 months.Hence, the intake of both, ascorbic acid and palmitate, at the MPL for food according to FC 13.1.1 and food according to FC 13.1.5.1 does not raise health concerns for infants below 16 weeks of age.The present opinion deals with:\n\nthe risk assessment of ascorbyl palmitate (E 304(i)) in food for infants below 16 weeks of age in the food categories 13.1.1 (Infant formulae as defined by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/127/EC1) and 13.1.5.1 (Dietary foods for infants for special medical purposes and special formulae for infants) as defined in Annex II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/20082 on food additives.\nthe follow‐up on issues that have been expressed in the conclusions and recommendations of the Scientific Opinion on the re‐evaluation of ascorbyl palmitate (E 304(i)) as a food additive (EFSA ANS Panel, 2015a).\nTaking into account the data submitted by interested business operators and the considerations from the Panel, a revision of the existing EU specifications for ascorbyl palmitate (E 304 (i)) has been recommended.Based on the presumption that ascorbyl palmitate fully hydrolyses pre‐systemically to ascorbic acid and palmitate, the Panel concluded that the intake of both metabolites, at the MPLs for ascorbyl palmitate as a food additive in infant formula belonging to FC 13.1.1 or in food for special medical purposes belonging to FC 13.1.5.1 does not raise safety concerns.The Panel recommends the European Commission to revise current specifications for the food additive ascorbyl palmitate (E 304(i)) in line with the proposals made in Table 14.In addition, the European Commission should consider harmonising the name of the food additive (E 304(i)) between Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.\n\n\nDuPont, 2019.

It is currently authorised in the European Union and it is intended to be used as a technological additive (functional group of emulsifiers), in feedingstuffs for all animal species, at a maximum concentration of 85 mg/kg complete feed. In 2019, the   Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed ( ) issued an opinion on the safety and efficacy of sorbitan monolaurate. Owing the lack of data, the   Panel could not conclude on the safety of the additive for the environment. The applicant submitted new data (fate and degradation as well as ecotoxicity data) that were evaluated in the present opinion. The absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of structurally related compounds (sorbitan monostearate and sorbitan trioleate) indicate that the additive is expected to be partially metabolised. In addition, sorbitan monolaurate and some related compounds are readily biodegradable. The limited available data on the effects of sorbitan monolaurate in marine crustaceans and in marine sediment indicate that the ecotoxicity of the additive is low, in consistency with the very low acute toxicity of sorbitan esters. Overall, the   Panel concludes that a risk of sorbitan monolaurate to terrestrial and aquatic environment is unlikely.

        "full-text": "Bacillus amyloliquefaciens AH2 is a new active substance for which, in accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the rapporteur Member State (RMS), the Netherlands, received an application from Probelte S.A. on 1 June 2015 for approval. Complying with Article 9 of the Regulation, the completeness of the dossier was checked by the RMS and the date of admissibility of the application was recognised as being 25 October 2015.An initial evaluation of the dossier on Bacillus amyloliquefaciens AH2 was provided by the RMS in the draft assessment report (DAR) and subsequently, a peer review of the pesticide risk assessment on the RMS evaluation was conducted by EFSA in accordance with Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. The following conclusions are derived.According to the representative uses as a fungicide on grapes, the uses of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2, as proposed at the European Union (EU) level, result in a sufficient fungicidal efficacy against the target grey mould.The assessment of the data package revealed no issues that need to be included as critical areas of concern with respect to the identity, physical and technical properties of the representative formulation.For the mammalian toxicology, considering the lack of scientific evidence, the relationship between the presence of secondary metabolites and/or toxins and the risk of adverse effects in humans cannot be excluded leading to an issue that could not finalised.Bacillus amyloliquefaciens AH2 may produce a range of metabolites, however not all of them were investigated as to whether these are produced on plants under good agricultural practice (GAP) directed use by the strain. Therefore, a consumer risk assessment cannot be finalised and a full characterisation of all potential metabolites relevant for this strain needs to be provided. In addition, it is recommended to establish the number of viable spores at the time of harvest for information and characterisation of the treated plant produce intended for human consumption.The information and evidence provided was considered insufficient to conclude on the likely competitiveness, persistence and multiplication of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens AH2 in soil and surface water.The risk assessment to birds, aquatic organisms, bees, other non‐target arthropods, earthworms and soil microorganisms could not be finalised.Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council1 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Regulation’) lays down, inter alia, the detailed rules as regards the procedure and conditions for approval of active substances. This regulates for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) the procedure for organising the consultation of Member States and the applicant(s) for comments on the initial evaluation in the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the rapporteur Member State (RMS), and the organisation of an expert consultation, where appropriate.In accordance with Article 12 of the Regulation, EFSA is required to adopt a conclusion on whether an active substance can be expected to meet the approval criteria provided for in Article 4 of the Regulation (also taking into consideration recital (10) of the Regulation) within 120 days from the end of the period provided for the submission of written comments, subject to an extension of 30 days where an expert consultation is necessary, and a further extension of up to 150 days where additional information is required to be submitted by the applicant(s) in accordance with Article 12(3).Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 is a new active substance for which, in accordance with Article 7 of the Regulation, the RMS, the Netherlands (hereinafter referred to as the ‘RMS’), received an application from Probelte S.A. on 1 June 2015 for approval of the active substance Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2. Complying with Article 9 of the Regulation, the completeness of the dossier was checked by the RMS and the date of admissibility of the application was recognised as being 25 October 2015.The RMS provided its initial evaluation of the dossier on Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 in the DAR, which was received by EFSA on 21 December 2017 (Netherlands, 2017). The peer review was initiated on 2 March 2018 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant, Probelte S.A., for consultation and comments. EFSA also provided comments. In addition, EFSA conducted a public consultation on the DAR. The comments received were collated by EFSA and forwarded to the RMS for compilation and evaluation in the format of a reporting table. The applicant was invited to respond to the comments in column 3 of the reporting table. The comments and the applicant's response were evaluated by the RMS in column 3.The need for expert consultation and the necessity for additional information to be submitted by the applicant in accordance with Article 12(3) of the Regulation were considered in a telephone conference between EFSA and the RMS on 23 July 2018. On the basis of the comments received, the applicant's response to the comments and the RMS's evaluation thereof, it was concluded that additional information should be requested from the applicant, and that EFSA should conduct an expert consultation in the area of ecotoxicology.The outcome of the telephone conference, together with EFSA's further consideration of the comments is reflected in the conclusions set out in column 4 of the reporting table. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase and which required further consideration, including those issues to be considered in an expert consultation, were compiled by EFSA in the format of an evaluation table.The conclusions arising from the consideration by EFSA, and as appropriate by the RMS, of the points identified in the evaluation table, together with the outcome of the expert consultation where this took place, were reported in the final column of the evaluation table.In accordance with Article 12 of the Regulation, EFSA should adopt a conclusion on whether Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 can be expected to meet the approval criteria provided for in Article 4 of the Regulation, taking into consideration recital (10) of the Regulation. A final consultation on the conclusions arising from the peer review of the risk assessment took place with Member States via a written procedure in April 2019 and April 2020.This conclusion report summarises the outcome of the peer review of the risk assessment on the active substance and the representative formulation evaluated on the basis of the representative use of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 as a fungicide on grapes as proposed by the applicant. In accordance with Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, risk mitigation options identified in the DAR and considered during the peer review are presented in the conclusion. Furthermore, this conclusion also addresses the assessment required from EFSA under Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, provided the active substance will be approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 without restrictions affecting the residue assessment. In the event of a non‐approval of the active substance or an approval with restrictions that have an impact on the residue assessment, this conclusion might no longer be relevant and a new assessment under Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 will be required. A list of the relevant end points for the active substance and the formulation is provided in Appendix A.In addition, a key supporting document to this conclusion is the peer review report (EFSA, 2020), which is a compilation of the documentation developed to evaluate and address all issues raised in the peer review, from the initial commenting phase to the conclusion. The peer review report comprises the following documents, in which all views expressed during the course of the peer review, including minority views where applicable, can be found:\n\nthe comments received on the DAR;\nthe reporting table (26 July 2018);\nthe evaluation table (8 May 2020);\nthe report(s) of the scientific consultation with Member State experts (where relevant);\nthe comments received on the assessment of the additional information (where relevant);\nthe comments received on the draft EFSA conclusion.\nGiven the importance of the DAR including its revisions (Netherlands, 2019) and the peer review report, both documents are considered as background documents to this conclusion.It is recommended that this conclusion report and its background documents would not be accepted to support any registration outside the European Union (EU) for which the applicant has not demonstrated that it has regulatory access to the information on which this conclusion report is based.Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 is a bacterium deposited at the Spanish Type Culture Collection (CECT), under the accession number CECT‐7221. Initially, the strain AH2 was identified as Bacillus velezensis. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 is a naturally occurring, indigenous wild type bacterium, initially isolated from cultivated soils in the region of Murcia, Spain.Due to availability of new data from fast sequencing tools, the taxonomy of the active substance was changed from the time of submission. It was proposed that the Bacilllus amyloliquefaciens clade should be considered as a taxonomic unit above species level, designated as ‘operational group Bacillus amyloliquefaciensi, consisting of the soil‐borne Bacilllus amyloliquefaciens, and plant‐associated Bacillus siamensis and B. velezensis, whose members are closely related.The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ‘PB001’, a suspension concentrate (SC) containing 993 g/L (nominal 1 × 1011 CFU/L, minimum content 7 × 1010 CFU/L, maximum 7 × 1011 CFU/L) Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2.The representative uses evaluated comprise applications by spraying on grapes, as a fungicide against Botrytis cinerea (grey mould). Full details of the good agricultural practice (GAP) can be found in the list of end points in Appendix A.Data were submitted to conclude that the uses of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 result in a sufficient fungicidal efficacy against grey mould, according to the representative uses proposed at EU level and following the guidance document SANCO/10054/2013 – rev. 3 (European Commission, 2013).The following guidance documents were considered in the production of this conclusion: European Commission, 2000, 2012 and EFSA, 2012.The technical grade of the microbial pest control agent (MPCA) is a hypothetical stage in a continuous production process of the end‐use product.Identification of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 at the strain level can be performed with molecular methods for 16S rRNA and gyrB sequence amplification, with sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.The taxonomy of the Bacillus subtilis group is dynamically changing due to availability of new data (mostly due to fast sequencing tools). It is noted that until the final clarification on taxonomy, the originally proposed name of the active substance is used in the conclusion.The analysis of contaminating microorganisms in commercially produced batches complies with the requirements of the Working Document on Microbial Contaminant Limits (European Commission, 2012). Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 is able to produce iturin A, fengycin and surfactin C as well as subtilisin. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 does not code for genes necessary for bacilysin production. The production of amylosin by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 under optimum growth conditions was investigated by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) analysis and its presence was not detected. It should be mentioned, however, that the limit of detection (LOD) of the method was unknown. Comparative genome analysis between strains known for the production of amylosin and those where amylosin production could not be detected, revealed a cluster which is likely associated with amylosin production (the putative amylosin cluster). The production of amylosin associated with that gene cluster could not be identified in the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 genome. It is therefore acknowledged that currently all available evidence suggested that the possibility of amylosin production by strain AH2 is rather low.Analysis of five batches of the microbial pest control product (MPCP) demonstrated that the formulated product contains very low amounts of surfactins, iturin A, fengycin and subtilisin. Their levels in the five batches were below 0.03 g/kg. Subtilisin was detected in the product below the quantification limit.The growth temperature range of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 is between 15°C and 50°C whereas the optimum growth temperature is 30–40°C. It is able to grow at a large pH range and it is sensitive to ultra violet light. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 was sensitive to a wide range of antibiotics (24 antibiotics) from different classes: β‐lactams such as penicillins and cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and glycopeptides, covering a representative range of antibiotics commonly used in human and veterinary medicine. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 is resistant to colistin and metronidazole; however colistin is effective against most Gram‐negative bacteria, while metronidazole is effective against Gram‐negative and Gram‐positive anaerobic bacteria.The supported shelf‐life of the product is 24 months at 5°C in COEX‐HDPE and HDPE bottles. Acceptable methods are available for the determination of the microorganism in the technical material and for the determination of the content of contaminating microorganisms. Appropriate validated analytical methods were available for the determination of the content impurities surfactin C, iturin A, fengycin and subtilisin in the formulated product PB001.A residue definition was not applicable for Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2, therefore post‐registration monitoring methods are not needed.\nGeneral data\nNo indications of any toxicological or allergenic effects to the workers involved in the production or packaging of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 since 2008 have been observed, with use of protective clothing, gloves and eye protection where necessary.From the literature review, some cases of allergenicity or sensitisation reactions caused by metabolites produced by strains of Bacilllus amyloliquefaciens were reported but no publication on hypersensitivity or chronic sensitisation caused by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 was found.Bacilllus amyloliquefaciens is recommended for the Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS) list (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2020) if it is qualified for the absence of toxigenic activity, and if the strain does not harbour any acquired antimicrobial resistance genes to clinically relevant antibiotics. Based on the available data, it cannot be concluded that these qualifications are met (see also Section 1).\nToxicity studies\nLaboratory studies on mammalian toxicity of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 have been conducted in rats upon oral, intratracheal or intravenous applications of acute single doses. Adverse effects were not reported. Signs of infection or accumulation were not observed. Persistent low caecum concentrations after oral administration were not considered infectious, considering the overall clearance of the microorganism.As the available methods for testing dermal sensitisation are not suitable for testing microorganisms and there are no validated test methods for sensitisation by inhalation, the following warning phrase is proposed: ‘Micro‐organisms may have the potential to provoke sensitising reactions’.From literature data, repeated oral administration of other strains of Bacilllus amyloliquefaciens was also performed to assess potential probiotic effects of these microorganisms. The results were a reduction of pathogenic clostridia in the faecal microbiota of dogs and a reduction of inflammatory bowel disease in a murine in vivo model.\nSecondary metabolites/toxins\nBacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 has the potential to produce the secondary metabolites iturin A, surfactin C, fengycin and subtilisin. Very low amounts were detected in the formulated product (see also Section 1). It is noted that iturins and surfactins belong to the lipopeptide family, and they are strong surfactants showing membrane‐damaging properties (lytic activity) in vitro.Toxicity studies with surfactin C, produced by strains of Bacilllus amyloliquefaciens or Bacilllus subtilis, were found in the literature. In a rat 28‐day oral study with surfactin C (produced by Bacilllus subtilis), the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 500 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day based on decreased body weight and liver toxicity. Surfactin C showed no genotoxic potential in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation assay, or in vivo in the bone marrow micronucleus test. It is noted that the exposure of the bone marrow may not have been sufficiently demonstrated to conclude reliably on the results of this test and it should be considered supplementary. In a developmental study in mice, surfactin C did not show maternal toxicity or teratogenicity potential.The toxin amylosin was shown to inhibit motility of boar sperm cells and to be cytotoxic to feline lung cells in vitro. Other in vitro tests with human cells indicated toxicity of amylosin produced by strains of Bacilllus amyloliquefaciens isolated from moisture‐damage buildings. Finally, amylosin was also identified in food poisoning outbreaks involving Bacilllus subtilis and Bacillus mojavensis. Based on the available data (see Section 1), amylosin seems unlikely to be produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens AH2.Considering the limited evidence available about their production and/or their toxicological profile, the relationship between the presence of secondary metabolites/toxins and the risk of illness in human cannot be excluded. The RMS is of the opinion that adequate information was provided to perform a risk assessment, considering that the microorganism is a natural component of the soil and that no adverse effects were observed in the human and in laboratory studies.\nReference values and exposure\nBased on the lack of significant toxicity, infectivity of pathogenicity in the available toxicological studies, the setting of health‐based reference values for the microorganism Bacillus amyloliquefaciens AH2 is not needed.Pending on further investigations on toxins/secondary metabolites produced after application, further considerations will have to be given to their potential toxicity in order to conclude on the risk assessment for workers and residents (data gap and issue not finalised).The strain Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 is naturally occurring and was isolated from cultivated soils.The representative use is a foliar treatment against grey mould (Botrytis cinerea) in grapes noting that this commodity belongs to the ‘high acid group’ of plant commodities. Additional field uses on lettuce, tomatoes and courgettes are anticipated all of which are representing ‘high water commodities’ (Netherlands, 2019). The high water commodities are less acidic compared to high acid commodities and can therefore be considered as a more favourable physiological environment with regard to survival, germination and growth of Bacillus spores.Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 spores are unlikely to multiply following application on edible parts and viable counts are declining to levels of around 1 % of the initially applied dose of around 108 CFU per leaf. Nevertheless, exact viable spores at the time of harvest are not reported and do not appear to have been determined. While it can be concluded that germination of introduced spores and subsequently viable cell multiplication during wine production is unlikely, information on the fate of spores in products with treated high water commodities would be more important since in a low‐acidic environments Bacillus spores could germinate and subsequently cell multiplication could occur.Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 may produce several metabolites; however, formation of all potential metabolites was not investigated following treatment considering the demonstrated decline characteristics of the strain. It seems unlikely that it produces amylosin (see Sections 1 and 2).The RMS is of the opinion that adequate information was provided to perform a risk assessment, considering that the microorganism is a natural component of the soil and that no adverse effects were observed in the human and in laboratory studies. The RMS highlighted that antifungal compounds are considered to be produced transiently during the direct interaction with the pathogens but will not accumulate thereafter.The RMS outlined that the literature data provided and the fact that the microorganism has a global natural distribution in soil, is a natural component of the soil and food web and that there are no adverse effects found for the microorganism in humans and in the laboratory studies. They deemed it sufficient to perform a tentative risk assessment.This assessment was supported by the fact that the species Bacilllus amyloliquefaciens was included on the EFSA QPS list for more than a decade however with a qualification of absence of toxigenic activity. This absence of toxigenic activity remains an open issue for strain AH2 (see Section 2).Overall, since a robust conclusion on all potentially relevant toxins/secondary metabolites formed by the strain cannot be drawn (see Sections 1 and 2), EFSA considers that the consumer risk assessment was not finalised and will need to be reconsidered when further information on metabolites becomes available. An inclusion in Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 cannot be recommended.Satisfactory information has been provided in relation to potential interference of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 with the analytical systems for the control of the quality of drinking water provided for in Directive 98/83/EC2 (see specific Annex VI decision making criteria in Part II Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/20113). The provided information support that these methods utilise chromogenic agents to which Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 does not give a response. Therefore it was considered unlikely that Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 would interfere with the methodologies used for such determinations.Bacillus amyloliquefaciens AH2 is a ‘wild type’ and there are no marker genes in the strain which would permit analysis of a frequency of genetic exchange. As the genetic diversity and drift in the wild‐type population has not been ascertained, it would not be possible to distinguish any genetic drift from that in the wild population based on the information provided. Though it is acknowledged that the possibility and effects of transfer of genetic material is not different for Bacillus amyloliquefaciens AH2 than for other naturally occurring Bacilllus amyloliquefaciens strains, transfer of genetic material by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens AH2 after application is possible and could not be excluded based on the information in the dossier.Some aspects of the risk assessment for Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 were discussed in the Pesticide Peer Review Meeting TC 200 on 22 January 2019.Suitable studies were available to demonstrate that Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AH2 is not infectious or pathogenic to mammals. The risk to mammals was therefore considered to be low. No studies were conducted with the product or Bacillus amyloliquefaciens AH2 with birds. The assessment relies on literature on other Bacillus species or Bacillus amyloliquefaciens of unknown strain where no infectivity of pathogenicity was observed. Furthermore, it was referred to the use of some Bacillus species as bird feed additives. It was discussed in the experts’ meeting whether the available information (including information on secondary metabolites) is sufficient to conclude on a low risk to birds. Uncertainties were identified with regard to the comparability of the Bacilllus amyloliquefaciens strain used in the plant protection product and the Bacillus species and Bacilllus amyloliquefaciens strains for which information was retrieved from studies with birds.5 The majority of the experts agreed that it is possible in a weight of evidence approach to conclude on a low risk to birds considering all available information and provided that the concentrations of secondary metabolites in the environment are likely to be low. However, a data gap was identified in section 4 on the formation and concentration of metabolites in the environment. Therefore, the risk assessment for birds is considered as not finalised also taking into account the uncertainty related to the lack of specific information for potential effects for Bacillus amyloliquefaciens AH2 and secondary metabolites on birds (data gap and issue that could not be finalised).Adequate studies were available with aquatic organisms showing no infectivity and pathogenicity to aquatic organisms. A high margin of safety was observed when comparing the endpoints with expected spore concentrations in the environment after spray drift entry into surface water. Therefore, a low risk to aquatic organisms was concluded. Information on the toxicity of the secondary metabolites iturin, fengycins, surfactin C and subtilisin to aquatic organisms is not available. It is unknown which amounts of secondary metabolites may be present in surface water (see data gap in Section 4). Therefore, no final conclusion can be drawn on the risk from secondary metabolites to aquatic organisms (data gap and issue that could not be finalised).Adequate studies were available with honeybees showing no infectivity and pathogenicity. Information was also available on the toxicity of some of the secondary metabolites iturin and surfactin C to bees. Exposure to iturin might affect bees (supplementary study, no information on the dose available). No effects on bees were observed from exposure to surfactin C (15.3 μg surfactin C/bee per day for 30 days). It is unknown which amounts of secondary metabolites are formed in the field (see data gap in Section 4) and to which amounts bees could be exposed. Therefore, no final conclusion can be drawn on the risk from secondary metabolites to bees (data gap and issue that could not be finalised).Studies with the product and Typhlodromus pyri and Aphidius rhopalosiphi were available indicating a low risk to non‐target arthropods. Effects on aphids were observed in a test with the secondary metabolite surfactin C. The product contains surfactin C in such low amounts that it is unlikely to cause effects in non‐target arthropods which is confirmed by the available studies with the product and Typhlodromus pyri and Aphidius rhopalosiphi. However, it is unknown to which amounts surfactin C will be produced in the environment (see data gap in Section 4) and therefore the risk assessment for non‐target arthropods other than bees cannot be finalised.No study with earthworms and the product was available. Published literature was used in a weight of evidence approach. Information was available that Bacilllus subtilis and probably all bacilli do not grow in the gut of earthworms and that the immune system of earthworms can cope with different Bacillus species.6 Based on all the information available, the majority of experts agreed that the risk can be regarded as likely to be low. A minority of the experts would require a new study for testing the effects on earthworms following the standard guidelines for microorganism testing. However, since no specific information regarding effects of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens AH2 on earthworms was available and a data gap was identified in Section 4, EFSA considers that it is it is not possible to finalise the risk assessment for earthworms (data gap and issue that could not be finalised).The RMS expects no unwanted effects on soil microbial communities based on information from public literature on other Bacilllus amyloliquefaciens strains and assuming low exposure of natural soils microbial communities. The RMS is of the opinion that further information is not relevant. However, no specific information was available to address the risk to soil microorganisms from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens AH2 and a data gap was identified in section 4 on fate and behaviour with regard to multiplication and persistence in soil.

        "full-text": "In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, Syngenta Agro GmbH submitted an application to the competent national authority in Germany (evaluating Member State, EMS) to modify the existing maximum residue level (MRL) for the active substance fludioxonil in elderberries. The EMS drafted an evaluation report in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on 24 October 2019. To accommodate for the intended NEU uses of fludioxonil, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRL from 0.8 to 4.0 mg/kg.EFSA assessed the application and the evaluation report as required by Article 10 of the MRL regulation.Based on the conclusions derived by EFSA in the framework of Directive 91/414/EEC, the data evaluated under previous MRL assessments, including the review of the existing fludioxonil MRLs according to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) 396/2005, and the additional data provided by the EMS in the framework of this application, the following conclusions are derived.The metabolism of fludioxonil following foliar application was investigated in crops belonging to the groups of fruit crops, leafy crops and root crops; in addition, metabolism studies for seed treatment in root crops, cereals/grasses and pulses/oilseeds are available.Studies investigating the effect of processing on the nature of fludioxonil (hydrolysis studies) demonstrated that the active substance is stable.In rotational crops, the metabolic pathway of fludioxonil is similar to that in primary crops. For the current application, as the proposed use of fludioxonil is on a permanent crop, investigations of residues in rotational crops are not required.Based on the metabolic pattern identified in metabolism studies, hydrolysis studies and the toxicological significance of metabolites, the residue definitions for plant products were proposed as ‘fludioxonil’ for enforcement and as ‘sum of fludioxonil and its metabolites oxidised to metabolite 2,2‐difluoro‐benzo[1,3]dioxole‐4 carboxylic acid (CGA 192155), expressed as fludioxonil’ for risk assessment. For fruit crops, relevant for the current assessment, the conversion factor of 1 from enforcement to risk assessment was derived in the MRL review. EFSA concluded that for elderberries, metabolism of fludioxonil in primary crops and the possible degradation in processed products has been sufficiently addressed and that the previously derived residue definitions are appropriate.Sufficiently validated analytical methods based on high‐performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS/MS) are available to quantify residues in the crops assessed in this application according to the enforcement residue definition at or above the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.01 mg/kg.The data submitted in support of this MRL application were found sufficient to derive an MRL proposal of 4.0 mg/kg in elderberries, which was derived by extrapolation from residue trials on red and black currants and blueberries. Residue trial samples were not analysed according to risk assessment residue definition, but this was not considered as a data gap since the metabolism of fludioxonil in fruit crops indicates insignificant concentrations of metabolites containing 2,2‐difluoro‐benzo[1,3] dioxole‐4 carboxylic acid moiety.Specific studies investigating the magnitude of fludioxonil residues in processed commodities are not required due to the low contribution of residues in elderberries to the total consumer exposure.Residues of fludioxonil in commodities of animal origin were not assessed since elderberries are not fed to livestock.The toxicological profile of fludioxonil was assessed in the framework of the EU pesticides peer review under Directive 91/414/EEC and the data were sufficient to derive an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0.37 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day. An acute reference dose (ARfD) was deemed unnecessary.The consumer risk assessment was performed with revision 3.1 of the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo). For the calculation of the chronic exposure to fludioxonil in elderberries, EFSA used the supervised trials median residue (STMR) value as derived from the trials in red and black currants and blueberries.For the remaining crops, the STMR values as reported by the MRL review and in succeeding reasoned opinions were used; for Codex MRLs implemented in the EU MRL legislation, the STMR values derived by the JMPR were taken into account in the risk assessment.The crops on which no EU uses were reported in the framework of the MRL review or in subsequent EFSA reasoned opinions have not been taken into account in the exposure calculation, assuming that these crops are not treated with fludioxonil. The long‐term exposure accounted for a maximum of 20% of the ADI (NL toddler diet); the contribution of residues in elderberries to the total consumer exposure was low (< 0.1% of the ADI).An acute exposure calculation was not required since for the active substance, no ARfD has been derived.EFSA concluded that the long‐term intake of residues of fludioxonil resulting from the existing and the intended uses is unlikely to present a risk to consumer health. As the procedure for the renewal of the approval of fludioxonil in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 is not yet finalised, the conclusions reported in this reasoned opinion may need to be reconsidered in the light of the outcome of the peer review.EFSA proposes to amend the existing MRL as reported in the summary table below.Full details of all endpoints and the consumer risk assessment can be found in Appendices B–D.\nCodeaCommodityExisting EU MRL (mg/kg)Proposed EU MRL (mg/kg)Comment/justificationEnforcement residue definition: FludioxonilF0154080Elderberries0.84The submitted data are sufficient to derive an MRL proposal for the intended NEU use of fludioxonil on elderberries (extrapolation from residue trials on red and black currants and blueberries).

The detailed description of the intended NEU use of fludioxonil in elderberries, which is the basis for the current MRL application, is reported in Appendix A.Fludioxonil is the ISO common name for 4‐(2,2‐difluoro‐1,3‐benzodioxol‐4‐yl)‐1H‐pyrrole‐3‐carbonitrile (IUPAC). The chemical structures of the active substance and its main metabolites are reported in Appendix E.Fludioxonil was evaluated in the framework of Directive 91/414/EEC1 with Denmark designated as rapporteur Member State (RMS) for the representative uses as a foliar application on table and wine grapes and seed treatment on wheat. The draft assessment report (DAR) prepared by the RMS has been peer reviewed by EFSA (EFSA, 2007). Fludioxonil was approved2 for the use as a fungicide on 1 November 2008. The process of renewal of the first approval is currently ongoing.The EU MRLs for fludioxonil are established in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 396/20053.The review of existing MRLs according to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 (MRL review) has been performed (EFSA, 2011a) and the proposed modifications have been implemented in the MRL legislation. After completion of the MRL review, EFSA has issued several reasoned opinions on the modification of MRLs for fludioxonil as well as on the evaluation of confirmatory data following the Article 12 MRL review for fludioxonil. The proposals from these reasoned opinions have been considered in recent MRL regulations.4EFSA based its assessment on the evaluation report submitted by the EMS (Germany, 2019), the draft assessment report (DAR) and its addendum (Denmark, 2005, 2007) prepared under Council Directive 91/414/EEC, the Commission review report on fludioxonil (European Commission, 2007), the conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fludioxonil (EFSA, 2007), as well as the conclusions from previous EFSA opinions on fludioxonil (EFSA, 2011b, 2012, 2013, 2016a,b, 2019b,c,d, 2020) and the EFSA scientific report (EFSA, 2019c).For this application, the data requirements established in Regulation (EU) No 544/20115 and the guidance documents applicable at the date of submission of the application to the EMS are applicable (European Commission, 1997a–h, 2000, 2010a,b, 2017; OECD, 2011, 2013). The assessment is performed in accordance with the legal provisions of the Uniform Principles for the Evaluation and the Authorisation of Plant Protection Products adopted by Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/20116.As the procedure for the renewal of the approval of fludioxonil in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 is not yet finalised, the conclusions reported in this reasoned opinion may need to be reconsidered in the light of the outcome of the peer review.A selected list of end points of the studies assessed by EFSA in the framework of this MRL application including the end points of relevant studies assessed previously, are presented in Appendix B.The evaluation report submitted by the EMS (Germany, 2019) and the exposure calculations using the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo version 3.1) are considered as supporting documents to this reasoned opinion and, thus, are made publicly available as background documents to this reasoned opinion.Not relevant for the current application since elderberries are not used as livestock feed item.The consumer risk assessment was performed with revision 3.1 of the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo). This exposure assessment model contains the relevant European food consumption data for different subgroups of the EU population EFSA et al. (2018, 2019a).The toxicological profile of fludioxonil was assessed in the framework of the EU pesticides peer review under Directive 91/414/EEC and the data were sufficient to derive an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0.37 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day. An acute reference dose (ARfD) was deemed unnecessary (European Commission, 2007).\nShort‐term (acute) dietary risk assessment\nConsidering the toxicological profile of the active substance, a short‐term dietary risk assessment was not required.\nLong‐term (chronic) dietary risk assessment\nFor the calculation of the chronic exposure resulting from the residues of fludioxonil in elderberries, EFSA used the supervised trials median residue (STMR) value derived from the residue trials on red and black currants and blueberries (see Section B.1.2.1). For the remaining crops, the STMR values as reported by the MRL review and in succeeding reasoned opinions were used (EFSA, 2011a, 2012, 2013, 2016a,b, 2019b,c,d, 2020) and the EFSA scientific report (EFSA, 2019c); for Codex MRLs implemented in the EU MRL legislation, the STMR values derived by the JMPR were taken into account in the risk assessment (FAO, 2012, 2013).The exposure calculation was performed only for those crops for which authorised uses were repo rted in the MRL review and for the accepted Codex MRLs taken over in the EU legislation.The crops on which no EU uses were reported in the framework of the MRL review or in subsequent EFSA reasoned opinions have not been taken into account in the exposure calculation, assuming that these crops are not treated with fludioxonil. The complete list of input values is presented in Appendix  D.1.The calculated long‐term exposure accounted for a maximum of 20% of the ADI (NL toddler diet); the contribution of residues in elderberries to the total consumer exposure was low (< 0.1% of the ADI) (See Appendix B.3).For further details on the exposure calculations, a screenshot of the Report sheet of the PRIMo 3.1 is presented in Appendix C.EFSA concluded that the long‐term intake of residues of fludioxonil resulting from the existing and the intended uses is unlikely to present a risk to consumer health.The data submitted in support of this MRL application were found to be sufficient to derive an MRL proposal of 4 mg/kg for fludioxonil in elderberries, as extrapolated from residue trials on red and black currants and blueberries, in support of the intended NEU GAP.EFSA concluded that the proposed use of fludioxonil on elderberries will not result in a long‐term consumer exposure exceeding the ADI value for fludioxonil and therefore is unlikely to pose a risk to consumers’ health.The MRL recommendations are summarised in Appendix B.4.\n\n\n\n\na.s.\n\nactive substance\n\n\n\n\nADI\n\nacceptable daily intake\n\n\n\n\nARfD\n\nacute reference dose\n\n\n\n\nBBCH\n\ngrowth stages of mono‐ and dicotyledonous plants\n\n\n\n\nbw\n\nbody weight\n\n\n\n\nCAC\n\nCodex Alimentarius Commission\n\n\n\n\nCAS\n\nChemical Abstract Service\n\n\n\n\nCCPR\n\nCodex Committee on Pesticide Residues\n\n\n\n\nCF\n\nconversion factor for enforcement to risk assessment residue definition\n\n\n\n\nCIRCA\n\n(EU) Communication & Information Resource Centre Administrator\n\n\n\n\nCS\n\ncapsule suspension\n\n\n\n\nCV\n\ncoefficient of variation (relative standard deviation)\n\n\n\n\nCXL\n\nCodex maximum residue limit\n\n\n\n\nDAR\n\ndraft assessment report\n\n\n\n\nDAT\n\ndays after treatment\n\n\n\n\nDM\n\ndry matter\n\n\n\n\nDP\n\ndustable powder\n\n\n\n\nDS\n\npowder for dry seed treatment\n\n\n\n\nEC\n\nemulsifiable concentrate\n\n\n\n\nEDI\n\nestimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nEMS\n\nevaluating Member State\n\n\n\n\neq\n\nresidue expressed as a.s. equivalent\n\n\n\n\nFAO\n\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n\n\n\n\nFID\n\nflame ionisation detector\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nGC\n\ngas chromatography\n\n\n\n\nGC‐FID\n\ngas chromatography with flame ionisation detector\n\n\n\n\nGC‐MS\n\ngas chromatography with mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nGC‐MS/MS\n\ngas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nGS\n\ngrowth stage\n\n\n\n\nHPLC\n\nhigh performance liquid chromatography\n\n\n\n\nHPLC‐MS\n\nhigh performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nHPLC‐MS/MS\n\nhigh‐performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nHR\n\nhighest residue\n\n\n\n\nIEDI\n\ninternational estimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nIESTI\n\ninternational estimated short‐term intake\n\n\n\n\nILV\n\nindependent laboratory validation\n\n\n\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organisation for Standardisation\n\n\n\n\nIUPAC\n\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n\n\n\n\nJMPR\n\nJoint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues\n\n\n\n\nLC\n\nliquid chromatography\n\n\n\n\nLOQ\n\nlimit of quantification\n\n\n\n\nMRL\n\nmaximum residue level\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nMember States\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nmass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nMS/MS\n\ntandem mass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nMW\n\nmolecular weight\n\n\n\n\nNEU\n\nnorthern Europe\n\n\n\n\nOECD\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development\n\n\n\n\nPBI\n\nplant back interval\n\n\n\n\nPF\n\nprocessing factor\n\n\n\n\nPHI\n\npre‐harvest interval\n\n\n\n\nPRIMo\n\n(EFSA) Pesticide Residues Intake Model\n\n\n\n\nQuEChERS\n\nQuick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (analytical method)\n\n\n\n\nRA\n\nrisk assessment\n\n\n\n\nRD\n\nresidue definition\n\n\n\n\nRMS\n\nrapporteur Member State\n\n\n\n\nSANCO\n\nDirectorate‐General for Health and Consumers\n\n\n\n\nSC\n\nsuspension concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSEU\n\nsouthern Europe\n\n\n\n\nSL\n\nsoluble concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSP\n\nwater‐soluble powder\n\n\n\n\nSTMR\n\nsupervised trials median residue\n\n\n\n\nTAR\n\ntotal applied radioactivity\n\n\n\n\nTRR\n\ntotal radioactive residue\n\n\n\n\nUV\n\nultraviolet (detector)\n\n\n\n\nWG\n\nwater‐dispersible granule\n\n\n\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n\n\nWP\n\nwettable powder\n\n\n"

        "full-text": "In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, the applicant LLG Sachsen‐Anhalt, Dez. Pflanzenschutz submitted an application to the competent national authority in Germany (evaluating Member State, EMS) to modify the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for copper compounds (hereafter copper) in fresh herbs and edible flowers. The EMS drafted an evaluation report in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on 20 June 2019. To accommodate for the intended EU indoor and NEU outdoor uses of copper hydroxide on herbs and edible flowers, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs in these commodities to 150 mg/kg.EFSA assessed the application and the evaluation report as required by Article 10 of the MRL regulation. EFSA identified points which needed further clarification, which were requested from the EMS Germany. On 3 February 2020, the EMS submitted the requested information in a revised evaluation report, which replaced the previously submitted evaluation report.Based on the conclusions derived by EFSA in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the review of the existing EU MRLs under Article 12 of the Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 and the data provided by the EMS in the Evaluation report in the framework of this application, the following conclusions are derived.Specific studies evaluating metabolism and distribution of residues in plants following the use of copper compounds as a plant protection product are not available. According to the public scientific literature, in plants, copper ions are absorbed from soil through the roots and then further transported to the rest of the plant. Upon foliar application, transportation and distribution of copper in plants are limited. As no metabolites are expected, the nature of residues in primary crops, rotational crops and processed commodities as well as the storage stability are considered addressed and specific studies are not required.The relevant residue for monitoring and risk assessment was defined as total copper, including copper residues arising from all forms of copper. Analytical methods for enforcement of mineral copper independently from its chemical form are available for matrices under consideration at the validated limit of quantification (LOQ) of 2 mg/kg.The available data are considered sufficient to derive an MRL proposal of 150 mg/kg as well as risk assessment values for fresh herbs and edible flowers in support of the intended EU indoor use of copper hydroxide. The intended NEU use is sufficiently supported by residue data, but results in a less critical residue situation for the crops under assessment. EFSA notes that the same MRL proposal (150 mg/kg) was recommended by the MRL review but has not yet been implemented.Specific studies investigating the magnitude of copper residues in processed herbs and edible flowers were not submitted and are not required considering low contribution of residues in these crops to the total theoretical maximum daily intake (TMDI).Since the intended new use of copper hydroxide on fresh herbs and edible flowers is in line with the restricted annual application rate and is below the application rates assessed in the renewal of the approval of copper compounds, EFSA concludes that the use on herbs and edible flowers is not the most critical with regard to residues in rotational crops. Moreover, the uptake of copper in succeeding crops is regulated by plant depending on its nutritional needs. It is noted that the MRL review derived MRLs for all plant commodities (also off‐label crops) included in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, considering residues from authorised uses as well as taking into consideration endogenous occurrence of copper in soil and plant commodities. These MRL proposals cover possible residue uptakes that may occur in rotational crops.Residues of copper in commodities of animal origin were not assessed since herbs and edible flowers are normally not fed to livestock.The toxicological profile of copper was assessed in the framework of the EU pesticides peer review under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 and the data were sufficient to derive an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0.15 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day. An acute reference dose (ARfD) was not deemed necessary. It is noted that EFSA has recently received a mandate to review the ADI for copper and to perform exposure calculations from all sources of copper (EFSA‐Q‐2020‐00399).In the framework of the MRL review, a comprehensive long‐term consumer exposure was performed using revision 2 of EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo). The exposure to copper residues was calculated from the authorised (existing) uses as well as from any other sources (background concentrations, uptake from soil, etc.). Two scenarios of exposure calculation were performed in the MRL review:\n\n\n‐scenario 1, considering all commodities of plant and animal origin;\n\n‐scenario 2, considering risk mitigation measures to reduce the exposure (for wine grapes, tomatoes, lettuces, the supervised trials median residue (STMR) values used in scenario 1 were replaced by STMR values that reflect the background level only; for potatoes, an STMR for a fall‐back GAP was used).\nAssuming that conclusions of the MRL review will be taken over in the EU legislation, EFSA now updated both exposure scenarios of the MRL review with the relevant STMR values as derived from the residue trials on herbs and edible flowers. The consumer risk assessment was performed with revision 3.1 of the EFSA PRIMo.The calculated long‐term dietary exposure to copper residues in both calculation scenarios exceeded the ADI. In scenario 1, the maximum exposure accounted for 169% of the ADI for Dutch toddler diet and for 102% of the ADI for Dutch child diet. In the MRL review, EFSA also identified a slight exceedance of the ADI for this scenario (108.9%; WHO Cluster diet B).In scenario 2, the calculated exposure accounted for a maximum of 166% of the ADI for Dutch toddler diet. EFSA notes that in the MRL review, the exposure calculated in scenario 2 identified no chronic consumer intake concern (93.4% of the ADI). The significant increase in the calculated exposure derived in the current assessment compared with the risk assessment performed in the framework of the MRL review is related to the use of the new version of EFSA PRIMo (revision 3.1) which contains updated food consumption data. The contribution of copper residues in fresh herbs and edible flowers on the actual long‐term consumer exposure is insignificant (0.11% of the ADI). Further refinements of the exposure calculation might be possible, once a decision is taken on the appropriate risk mitigation measures that will be implemented.EFSA concluded that the long‐term consumer intake concerns cannot be excluded for the intake of copper residues resulting from the intended uses, existing uses and background/monitoring levels. Although residues in herbs and edible flowers are minor contributors to the overall consumer exposure, a risk management decision has to be taken whether it is appropriate to increase the existing MRLs for these crops, given that a potential consumer intake concern could not be excluded.EFSA proposes to amend the existing MRLs as reported in the summary table below.Full details of all endpoints and the consumer risk assessment can be found in Appendices B–D.\nCodeaCommodityExistingEU MRL/MRL proposals Art. 12 review (mg/kg)ProposedEU MRL (mg/kg)Comment/justificationEnforcement residue definition: Copper compounds (copper)0256000, except 0256030Herbs and edible flowers (except celery leaves)20/150Further risk management considerations requiredThe submitted data are sufficient to derive an MRL proposal of 150 mg/kg in support of the intended indoor use of copper hydroxide.

The detailed description of the intended uses of copper hydroxide which are the basis for the current MRL application is reported in Appendix A.Copper hydroxide is the common name for copper (II) hydroxide (or copper (2+) hydroxide or cupric hydroxide) (IUPAC). The active substances are copper(I) and copper (II) ions.Copper compounds1 have been evaluated for renewal of the approval in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107/20092 with France designated as rapporteur Member State (RMS); the representative uses assessed were used as fungicide/bactericide on field applications on grapes and field and greenhouse applications on tomatoes and cucurbits. The renewal assessment report (RAR) prepared by the RMS has been peer reviewed by EFSA (EFSA, 2018b). The peer review conclusions of EFSA published in 2018 (EFSA, 2018b), supersede the previous EFSA assessments (EFSA, 2008, 2013). The decision on the renewal of copper compounds entered into force on 1 January 2019.3 The use of plant protection products containing copper compounds is restricted to a maximum application rate of 28 kg/ha of copper over a period of 7 years (i.e. on average 4 kg/ha per year).4 The EU MRLs covering the uses of the different copper compounds are established in Annex III of Regulation (EC) No 396/20055; the MRLs are expressed on the basis of copper ions (all forms of copper present in the plant converted to Cu2+). The review of existing EU MRLs for copper compounds according to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 (MRL review) has been performed (EFSA, 2018c). The MRL proposals have not yet been implemented in the EU MRL regulation.In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, the applicant LLG Sachsen‐Anhalt, Dez. Pflanzenschutz, submitted an application to the competent national authority in Germany (evaluating Member State, EMS) to modify the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for copper in fresh herbs and edible flowers. The EMS drafted an evaluation report in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on 20 June 2019. To accommodate for the intended EU indoor and NEU outdoor uses of copper hydroxide on herbs and edible flowers, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs in these commodities to 150 mg/kg. EFSA assessed the application and the evaluation report as required by Article 10 of the MRL regulation. EFSA identified points which needed further clarification, which were requested from the EMS. On 3 February 2020, the EMS submitted the requested information in a revised evaluation report, which replaced the previously submitted evaluation report.EFSA based its assessment on the evaluation report submitted by the EMS (Germany, 2018), the renewal assessment report (RAR) (and its addendum) (France, 2016, 2017) prepared under Regulation (EC) 1107/2009, the Commission renewal review report on copper compounds (European Commission, 2018), the conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of copper compounds (EFSA, 2018b), as well as the conclusions from the EFSA reasoned opinion on the review of the existing maximum residue levels for copper compounds according to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 (EFSA, 2018c).For this application, the data requirements established in Regulation (EU) No 283/20136 and the guidance documents applicable at the date of submission of the application to the EMS are applicable (European Commission, 2010a,b, 2017; OECD, 2007a,b, 2009, 2011, 2016). The assessment is performed in accordance with the legal provisions of the Uniform Principles for the Evaluation and the Authorisation of Plant Protection Products adopted by Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/20117.The evaluation report submitted by the EMS (Germany, 2018) and the exposure calculations using the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) are considered as supporting documents to this reasoned opinion and, thus, are made publicly available as background documents to this reasoned opinion.Not relevant as crops under consideration are not used for feed purposes.In the framework of the MRL review, a comprehensive long‐term exposure assessment was performed using revision 2 of EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo), taking into account the exposure to copper from authorised (existing) uses as well as from any other sources (background concentrations, uptake from soil etc.). The commodities on which no uses were reported in the MRL review were therefore also included in the calculation. Two scenarios of exposure calculation were performed in the MRL review:\n\n\n‐scenario 1, including all commodities of plant and animal origin;\n\n‐scenario 2, considering risk mitigation measures to reduce the exposure (for wine grapes, tomatoes, lettuces, the STMR values used in scenario 1 were replaced by STMR values that reflect the background level only; for potatoes, an STMR for a fall‐back GAP was used).\nAssuming that conclusions of the MRL review will be taken over in the EU legislation, EFSA now updated both exposure scenarios of the MRL review with the relevant STMR values as derived from the residue trials on herbs and edible flowers (Appendix B.1.2.1) as submitted in support of this MRL application; it is noted that the STMR value for fresh herbs and edible flowers used in the previous risk assessment was only slightly lower than the STMR value derived in the current assessment (34.6 mg/kg vs. 38 mg/kg). The summary of the input values for commodities other than fresh herbs and edible flowers is available in the Appendix D.2 of EFSA reasoned opinion on the review of the existing MRLs for copper compounds (EFSA, 2018c).For the current assessment, EFSA used revision 3.1 of the EFSA PRIMo. This exposure assessment model contains the relevant European food consumption data for different subgroups of the EU population (EFSA, 2018a, 2019).The toxicological reference value for copper compounds used in the risk assessment (i.e. ADI value of 0.15 mg/kg bw day) was derived in the framework of the EU pesticides peer review (European Commission, 2018).8 The setting of the ARfD was considered not necessary.The calculated long‐term dietary exposure to copper residues in both calculation scenarios exceeded the ADI. In scenario 1, the maximum exposure accounted for 169% of the ADI for Dutch toddler diet and for 102% of the ADI for Dutch child diet. It is noted that an exceedance of the ADI (108.9%; WHO Cluster diet B) was also identified in the MRL review for scenario 1 (EFSA, 2018c).In scenario 2, which comprises the risk mitigation measures applied by the MRL review, the calculated exposure accounted for a maximum of 166% of the ADI for Dutch toddler diet. EFSA notes that in the MRL review, the exposure calculated in scenario 2 identified no chronic consumer intake concern (93.4% of the ADI) (EFSA, 2018c).The significant increase in the calculated exposure derived in the current assessment compared with the risk assessment performed in the framework of the MRL review is related to the use of the new version of EFSA PRIMo (revision 3.1) which contains updated food consumption data. The contribution of copper residues in fresh herbs and edible flowers to the actual long‐term consumer exposure is very low (0.11% of the ADI). Further refinements of the exposure calculation might be possible, once a decision is taken on the appropriate risk mitigation measures that will be implemented.EFSA concluded that the long‐term consumer intake concerns cannot be excluded for the intake of copper residues resulting from the intended uses, existing uses and background/monitoring levels. Although residues in herbs and edible flowers from the new intended use contribute insignificantly to the overall consumer exposure, a risk management decision has to be taken whether it is appropriate to increase the existing MRL for herbs and edible flowers from 20 or 50 mg/kg9 to 150 mg/kg, given that, based on the currently available information, potential consumer intake concerns cannot be excluded.For further details on the exposure calculations, a screenshot of the Report sheet of the PRIMo is presented in Appendix C.The data submitted in support of this MRL application were found to be sufficient to derive an MRL proposal of 150 mg/kg for copper in fresh herbs and edible flowers in support of the intended indoor use of copper hydroxide. The intended NEU use is sufficiently supported by residue data, but results in a less critical residue situation in the crops. EFSA notes that the same MRL proposal (150 mg/kg) was recommended by the MRL review, but so far has not been implemented.EFSA concluded that the long‐term consumer intake concerns cannot be excluded for the intake of copper residues resulting from the intended uses, existing uses and background/monitoring levels. Residues in herbs and edible flowers resulting from the new intended use contribute to a very low extent to the overall consumer exposure. A risk management decision has to be taken whether it is appropriate to increase the existing MRL for herbs and edible flowers from 20 or 50 mg/kg9 to 150 mg/kg, given that, based on the currently available information, potential consumer intake concerns cannot be excluded.The MRL recommendations are summarised in Appendix B.4.\n\n\n\n\na.s.\n\nactive substance\n\n\n\n\nADI\n\nacceptable daily intake\n\n\n\n\nARfD\n\nacute reference dose\n\n\n\n\nBBCH\n\ngrowth stages of mono‐ and dicotyledonous plants\n\n\n\n\nbw\n\nbody weight\n\n\n\n\nCAC\n\nCodex Alimentarius Commission\n\n\n\n\nCAS\n\nChemical Abstract Service\n\n\n\n\nCF\n\nconversion factor for enforcement to risk assessment residue definition\n\n\n\n\nCIRCA\n\n(EU) Communication & Information Resource Centre Administrator\n\n\n\n\nCS\n\ncapsule suspension\n\n\n\n\nCV\n\ncoefficient of variation (relative standard deviation)\n\n\n\n\nDAR\n\ndraft assessment report\n\n\n\n\nDAT\n\ndays after treatment\n\n\n\n\nDM\n\ndry matter\n\n\n\n\nDP\n\ndustable powder\n\n\n\n\nDS\n\npowder for dry seed treatment\n\n\n\n\nDT90\n\nperiod required for 90% dissipation (define method of estimation)\n\n\n\n\nEC\n\nemulsifiable concentrate\n\n\n\n\nEDI\n\nestimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nEMS\n\nevaluating Member State\n\n\n\n\neq\n\nresidue expressed as a.s. equivalent\n\n\n\n\nFID\n\nflame ionisation detector\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nGC\n\ngas chromatography\n\n\n\n\nGC‐FID\n\ngas chromatography with flame ionisation detector\n\n\n\n\nGC‐MS\n\ngas chromatography with mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nGC‐MS/MS\n\ngas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nGS\n\ngrowth stage\n\n\n\n\nHR\n\nhighest residue\n\n\n\n\nIEDI\n\ninternational estimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nILV\n\nindependent laboratory validation\n\n\n\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organisation for Standardisation\n\n\n\n\nIUPAC\n\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n\n\n\n\nLC\n\nliquid chromatography\n\n\n\n\nLOQ\n\nlimit of quantification\n\n\n\n\nMRL\n\nmaximum residue level\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nMember States\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nmass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nMS/MS\n\ntandem mass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nMW\n\nmolecular weight\n\n\n\n\nNEU\n\nnorthern Europe\n\n\n\n\nOECD\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development\n\n\n\n\nPBI\n\nplant back interval\n\n\n\n\nPF\n\nprocessing factor\n\n\n\n\nPHI\n\npre‐harvest interval\n\n\n\n\nPRIMo\n\n(EFSA) Pesticide Residues Intake Model\n\n\n\n\nRA\n\nrisk assessment\n\n\n\n\nRAR\n\nrenewal assessment report\n\n\n\n\nRD\n\nresidue definition\n\n\n\n\nRMS\n\nrapporteur Member State\n\n\n\n\nSANCO\n\nDirectorate‐General for Health and Consumers\n\n\n\n\nSC\n\nsuspension concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSEU\n\nsouthern Europe\n\n\n\n\nSL\n\nsoluble concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSP\n\nwater‐soluble powder\n\n\n\n\nSTMR\n\nsupervised trials median residue\n\n\n\n\nTAR\n\ntotal applied radioactivity\n\n\n\n\nTMDI\n\ntheoretical maximum daily intake\n\n\n\n\nUV\n\nultraviolet (detector)\n\n\n\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n"

        "full-text": "Aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus is a new active substance for which, in accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the rapporteur Member State (RMS), the Netherlands, received an application from CEV SA on 7 June 2016 for approval. In addition, the applicant submitted an application for inclusion of the substance in Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. Complying with Article 9 of the Regulation, the completeness of the dossier was checked by the RMS and the date of admissibility of the application was recognised as being 18 January 2017.An initial evaluation of the dossier on the active substance aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus (formerly: Sweet Lupin (seeds), Lupinus albus L., germ., ext.) was provided by the RMS in the draft assessment report (DAR), and subsequently, a peer review of the pesticide risk assessment on the RMS evaluation was conducted by EFSA in accordance with Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. The following conclusions are derived.The uses of aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus, according to the representative uses as a fungicide on field and protected strawberry and tomatoes, as proposed at EU level, result in a sufficient fungicidal efficacy against the target organisms.The assessment of the data package revealed no issues that need to be included as critical areas of concern with respect to the identity, physical and technical properties of the aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus or the representative formulation.In the area of mammalian toxicology and non‐dietary exposure, critical areas of concern or issues that could not be finalised were not identified.An MRL application for inclusion of the active substance in Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 has been submitted. The aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus is proposed to be included in Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 on the basis of expert judgement, although the criteria for the inclusion in the Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 are not met.The data available on environmental fate and behaviour are sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level.In the area of ecotoxicology, low risk to birds and mammals, aquatic organisms, non‐target arthropods, earthworms and soil microorganisms, non‐target terrestrial plants and sewage treatment organisms is concluded for all the representative uses. Critical areas of concern or issues that could not be finalised were not identified.The aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus does not meet the criteria for endocrine disruption for humans and non‐target organisms according to points 3.6.5 and 3.8.2 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) 2018/605.Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council1 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Regulation’) lays down, inter alia, the detailed rules as regards the procedure and conditions for approval of active substances. This regulates for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) the procedure for organising the consultation of Member States and the applicant(s) for comments on the initial evaluation in the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the rapporteur Member State (RMS), and the organisation of an expert consultation, where appropriate.In accordance with Article 12 of the Regulation, EFSA is required to adopt a conclusion on whether an active substance can be expected to meet the approval criteria provided for in Article 4 of the Regulation (also taking into consideration recital (10) of the Regulation) within 120 days from the end of the period provided for the submission of written comments, subject to an extension of 30 days where an expert consultation is necessary, and a further extension of up to 150 days where additional information is required to be submitted by the applicant(s) in accordance with Article 12(3).Aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus is a new active substance for which, in accordance with Article 7 of the Regulation, the RMS, the Netherlands (hereinafter referred to as the ‘RMS’), received an application from CEV SA on 7 June 2016 for approval of the active substance sweet lupin (seeds), Lupinus albus L., germ., ext. This name was changed during the evaluation procedure to aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus. In addition, the applicant submitted an application for inclusion of the substance in Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/20052. Complying with Article 9 of the Regulation, the completeness of the dossier was checked by the RMS and the date of admissibility of the application was recognised as being 18 January 2017.The RMS provided its initial evaluation of the dossier on the active substance aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus in the DAR, which was received by EFSA on 1 April 2019 (The Netherlands, 2019). The peer review was initiated on 30 April 2019 by dispatching the DAR to the Member States and the applicant, CEV SA, for consultation and comments. EFSA also provided comments. In addition, EFSA conducted a public consultation on the DAR. The comments received were collated by EFSA and forwarded to the RMS for compilation and evaluation in the format of a reporting table. The applicant was invited to respond to the comments in column 3 of the reporting table. The comments and the applicants’ response were evaluated by the RMS in column 3.The need for expert consultation and the necessity for additional information to be submitted by the applicant in accordance with Article 12(3) of the Regulation were considered in a telephone conference between EFSA and the RMS on 5 September 2019. On the basis of the comments received, the applicant's response to the comments and the RMS's evaluation thereof, it was concluded that additional information should be requested from the applicant, and that EFSA should conduct an expert consultation in the areas of mammalian toxicology and ecotoxicology.The outcome of the telephone conference, together with EFSA's further consideration of the comments, is reflected in the conclusions set out in column 4 of the reporting table. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase and which required further consideration, including those issues to be considered in an expert consultation, were compiled by EFSA in the format of an evaluation table.The conclusions arising from the consideration by EFSA, and as appropriate by the RMS, of the points identified in the evaluation table, together with the outcome of the expert consultation where this took place, were reported in the final column of the evaluation table.In accordance with Article 12 of the Regulation, EFSA should adopt a conclusion on whether the active substance aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus can be expected to meet the approval criteria provided for in Article 4 of the Regulation, taking into consideration recital (10) of the Regulation.A final consultation on the conclusions arising from the peer review of the risk assessment and on the proposal for inclusion of the substance in Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 took place with Member States via a written procedure in May–June 2020.This conclusion report summarises the outcome of the peer review of the risk assessment on the active substance and the representative formulation evaluated on the basis of the representative uses of the aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus, as a fungicide on strawberry and tomatoes (field use and greenhouse application) as proposed by the applicant. In accordance with Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, risk mitigation options identified in the DAR and considered during the peer review, if any, are presented in the conclusion.Furthermore, this conclusion also addresses the requirement for an assessment by EFSA under Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, provided that the active substance will be approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 without restrictions affecting the residue assessment. In the event of a non‐approval of the active substance or an approval with restrictions that have an impact on the residue assessment, the Annex IV proposal, if any, from this conclusion might no longer be relevant and a new assessment under Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 will be required.A list of the relevant end points for the active substance and the formulation is provided in Appendix A.In addition, a key supporting document to this conclusion is the peer review report (EFSA, 2020), which is a compilation of the documentation developed to evaluate and address all issues raised in the peer review, from the initial commenting phase to the conclusion. The peer review report comprises the following documents, in which all views expressed during the course of the peer review, including minority views where applicable, can be found:\n\nthe comments received on the DAR;\nthe reporting table (10 September 2019);\nthe evaluation table (15 June 2020);\nthe report(s) of the scientific consultation with Member State experts (where relevant);\nthe comments received on the assessment of the additional information (where relevant);\nthe comments received on the draft EFSA conclusion.\nGiven the importance of the DAR including its revisions (The Netherlands, 2020) and the peer review report, both documents are considered as background documents to this conclusion.It is recommended that this conclusion and its background documents would not be accepted to support any registration outside the EU for which the applicant has not demonstrated that it has regulatory access to the information on which this conclusion report is based.The active substance aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus is considered by the International Organization for Standardization not to require a common name. It is an extract from sweet lupin, its main component, the BLAD protein (not ISO 1750), is registered at GenBank at NCBI with accession number DQ142920.1 (Lupinus albus BLAD mRNA, partial cds). The original name used for the active substance was ‘sweet lupin (seeds), Lupinus albus L., germ., ext.’. This name was changed during the evaluation procedure based on the proposal of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), who received a submission for harmonised classification for the same substance.The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ‘Problad Plus’, a soluble concentrate (SL) containing 1,000 g/kg aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus, corresponding to a nominal content of 200 g/kg BLAD protein. An FAO specification does not exist for this product.The representative uses evaluated comprise spray applications against foliar fungi in field cultivation of strawberry and tomatoes in the Southern and Central European zones and spray applications in protected strawberry and tomatoes in the EU. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of end points in Appendix A.Data were submitted to conclude that the uses of aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus according to the representative uses proposed at EU level result in a sufficient fungicidal efficacy, following the guidance document SANCO/10054/2013‐rev. 3 (European Commission, 2013).The following guidance documents were followed in the production of this conclusion: European Commission, 2000a,b, 2010, 2012, 2013.The active substance aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus is considered a UVCB substance (Substance of Unknown or Variable composition, Complex reaction product or Biological material). The lead component BLAD (‘Banda de Lupinus albus doce’) is a naturally occurring seed storage protein in germinated sweet lupins; it is a 210 kDa glyco‐oligomer containing mainly a polypeptide of β‐conglutin.The technical material is only a hypothetical stage in the continuous production process of the end use product. As a consequence, the specification is given only for the formulation ‘Problad Plus’’. The specification is based on pilot scale production. The extract has a declared purity of 1,000 g/kg. The content of the lead component BLAD is between 195 and 210 g/kg (the minimum content of BLAD is 330 g/kg on dry weight basis). Quinolizidine alkaloids (QAs; lupanine, 13α‐OH‐lupanine, 13α‐angeloyloxylupanine, lupinine, albine, angustofoline, 13α‐tigloyloxylupanine, α‐isolupanine, tetrahydrohombifoline, multiflorine, sparteine) were considered as relevant compounds that need to be specified (see Section 2). As a consequence, a data gap was identified for five‐batch data of the quinolizidine alkaloids and a corresponding specification.The assessment of the data package revealed no issues that need to be included as critical areas of concern with respect to the identity, physical and technical properties of the representative formulation. It should be noted that label instructions are needed concerning the measures to address foaming and stability of dilutions of the formulation.Acceptable method was available for the determination of the BLAD in the representative formulation. A data gap was identified for an analytical method for the determination of total quinolizidine alkaloids in the product. It should be noted that an analytical method exists for the determination of the lupanine content in the representative formulation.Since residue definitions were not defined in any compartments, methods for post‐authorisation control and monitoring purposes are not required.The toxicological profile of the active substance aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus was discussed at the Pesticides Peer Review Experts’ Teleconference 25 (March 2020) and assessed based on the following guidance documents: European Commission (2003, 2012, 2014a), EFSA PPR Panel (2012), EFSA (2014) and ECHA (2017a).The active substance is considered as a botanical active substance as defined in SANCO/11470/2012 – rev.8 (European Commission, 2014a). The toxicological profile of the active substance was assessed based on toxicity studies that were representative of the proposed technical specification for the active substance. The experts agreed that total quinolizidine alkaloids (QAs) are considered relevant components given their neurotoxic potential (EFSA CONTAM Panel, 2019). The provisional maximum content for total QAs3 (see confidential information in DAR Volume 4, April 2020) was calculated considering the content of lupanine in the five‐batch analysis and with the assumption that lupanine is around 70% of total QAs4 since method(s) of analysis for total QAs are not yet available (see data gap in Section 1). The provisional maximum content of total QAs in the specification is acceptable from the toxicological point of view (see confidential information in DAR Volume 4, April 2020). However, further refinement is needed since EFSA considered that the 11 QAs which are considered most relevant with respect to occurrence in lupin species for human and animal consumption in Europe (lupanine, 13α‐OH‐lupanine, 13α‐angeloyloxylupanine, lupinine, albine, angustofoline, 13α‐tigloyloxylupanine, α‐isolupanine, tetrahydrohombifoline, multiflorine, sparteine) (EFSA CONTAM Panel, 2019) should be measured (see data gap in Section 1).Specific toxicokinetics studies have not been conducted. As the active substance contains the naturally occurring polypeptide component, BLAD, the protein will be broken down, enter the amino acid pool and will be consumed into normal catabolic processes. Considering the nature of the active substance, a residue definition for body fluids and tissues is not necessary. For the risk assessment, an oral absorption of 100% is assumed. In the acute toxicity studies, the active substance has low acute toxicity when administered orally, dermally or by inhalation to rats. It is not a skin or eye irritant. A phototoxicity and photogenotoxicity test is not required for the active substance. In the 90‐day oral rat toxicity study, a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 500 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day was set by the majority of experts based on vacuolation in brain and spinal cord in one female at 1,000 mg/kg bw per day. The RMS did not agree. In the 22‐day dermal rat toxicity study, an NOAEL of 300 mg/kg bw per day was set based on increased adrenal weight. The active substance is unlikely to be genotoxic in vivo. Further toxicological studies (i.e. carcinogenicity or reproductive toxicity) were not available and were considered unnecessary by the majority of the experts; there were no indications of any link to carcinogenicity or reproductive toxicity from the active substance in the public literature.The experts agreed that the active substance should not be considered a skin sensitiser according to the results of the Buehler test. The applicant provided some evidence that the active substance may not be a food allergen; however, lupins and lupin products, from which the active substance is derived, have been included in the group of allergens which must appear in the labelling of foodstuffs in Regulation (EU) No 1169/20115. On this basis, medical treatment should be proposed by the applicant leading to a data gap. In addition, the applicant should further address the relevance of existing findings/case reports on L. albus intoxication in humans for the active substance as described by the EFSA CONTAM Panel, 2019.The agreed acceptable daily intake (ADI) and systemic acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) are 5 mg/kg bw per day, on the basis of the relevant short‐term NOAEL of 500 mg/kg bw per day in the 90‐day study in rats based on vacuolation in brain and spinal cord in one female at 1,000 mg/kg bw per day. An uncertainty factor (UF) of 100 was applied. Given the nature of the active substance and considering that there were no indications of any link to carcinogenicity or reproductive toxicity of the active substance in the public literature, an additional UF was not considered necessary despite the limited data package available. A correction factor for oral absorption/systemic bioavailability is not needed to derive the AOEL. The experts agreed that an acute reference dose (ARfD) or acute acceptable operator exposure level (AAOEL) was not needed for the active substance.The RMS estimated non‐dietary exposure (i.e. operator, worker, bystander and resident exposure estimates) considering a default dermal absorption value of 25% for the concentrate and the dilution as input values. Considering the representative uses as a fungicide in strawberry and tomato (outdoor and indoor uses), the maximum estimated operator exposure was below the AOEL (59% of the AOEL) without the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and loading and application according to the Dutch Model (indoor uses). Worker exposure was below the AOEL without the use of PPE (maximum 96% of the AOEL, strawberry (outdoor/indoor uses)). Resident exposure was below the AOEL (maximum 13% of the AOEL; child resident, tomato (outdoor use)). Bystander was not calculated because an acute AOEL (AAOEL) was not required for the active substance.The assessment in the residue section is based on the following guidance documents: OECD (2009, 2011), European Commission (2011) and JMPR (2004, 2007).No standard studies according to EU/OECD guidance documents and EU data requirements have been submitted to address the metabolic behaviour of aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus, for the representative uses.In two supportive studies conducted at 0.5 N rate, the fate of aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus, when applied to grape leaves and tomatoes was investigated and provided evidence that the lead component BLAD, which forms 20% w/w of the formulation ‘Problad Plus’’ is degraded 18 h after application and no longer detectable in the investigated tissues.Supervised residue trials with strawberries, tomatoes and grapes were performed in the US according to the proposed GAPs. As the analytical method provides only semiquantitative results and information on the storage stability of BLAD was not available, these trials were considered only supportive.The aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus is proposed for inclusion in Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 provided that the outstanding issues regarding quinolizidine alkaloids (QAs) are cleared (see Section 2). Although none of the five criteria listed in the guidance document on criteria for the inclusion of active substances into Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 (European Commission, 2015) are met, the proposal is supported on the basis of expert judgement as outlined in the Evaluation table (Open point 3.3; EFSA, 2020).A residue definition is not meaningful as the major compound is a naturally occurring seed storage protein which was shown to be degraded when applied according to the representative uses and cannot not be regarded unique, nor would be any other compound of the aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus be a good marker for the residue definition for enforcement.Therefore, in this specific case, further data on plant metabolism, residue trials for the representative uses, storage stability as well as residue definitions are not required.It is also acknowledged that an ADI of 5 mg/kg bw per day has been proposed, but a consumer risk assessment is not deemed necessary for the reasons given above.However, given that the allergenic potential has not be fully addressed by the applicant and lupins and lupin products, from which the active substance is derived, have been included in the group of allergens which must appear in the labelling of foodstuffs as well considering that the proposed foliar application might lead to residues of lupin allergens on or in foodstuffs, a potential risk for vulnerable consumer groups due to the allergenic properties can not be excluded.Literature search was conducted for both the aqueous extract from the seeds of sweet Lupinus albus and the quinolizidine alkaloids.Residues in pollen and honey bee products were not investigated and based on the above given reasons further information is not necessary; but not on grounds that the application is conducted after the flowering which is according to the GAP not correct.Aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus consists of many different components; the main one is the protein BLAD which represents 20% of the formulated product ‘Problad Plus’. Protein BLAD is not isolated during the preparation of the product, and therefore, the majority of the studies were carried out using the formulated product ‘Problad Plus’.The rates of degradation in the soil and surface water and sediment were estimated based on ready biodegradability tests and ECHA Guidance (2017b). Aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus and its major component protein BLAD were demonstrated to be readily biodegradable. Since in ECHA (2017b), the relevant reference temperature for degradation is 12°C, in the present assessment data were normalised to 20°C as this is the reference temperature used by the relevant calculation tools used for active substances in plant protection product exposure assessments.Aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus exhibited moderate to high persistence in soil considering the ECHA Guidance (2017b).Experimental studies were not available for the determination of the mobility of aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus in soil. However, QSAR estimations of adsorption were made for protein BLAD and the relevant impurity lupanine. Protein BLAD was indicated to exhibit immobility in soil, while lupanine was indicated to exhibit moderate to low mobility in soil.In natural sediment water systems, protein BLAD was considered to exhibit low persistence considering the ECHA Guidance (2017b).The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments (predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) calculations) were carried out for the formulated product ‘Problad Plus’, using the FOCUS (FOCUS, 2001) step 1 and step 2 approach (version 3.2 of the Steps 1–2 in FOCUS calculator). The surface water and sediment exposure assessments for the representative protected uses were considered covered by the available calculations for the field uses.The necessary groundwater exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using FOCUS (European Commission, 2014b) scenarios and the models PEARL 4.4.4, PELMO 5.5.3 and MACRO 5.5.4. The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative uses by the indicator compounds of the aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 μg/L was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all nine FOCUS groundwater scenarios.The applicant provided some information to address the effect of water treatment processes on the nature of the residues that might be present in surface water, when surface water is abstracted for drinking water. The information justifying the dilution factors proposed between small water bodies and large ones where drinking water abstraction would take place was considered inappropriate. However, considering the indicated high adsorption characteristics of the indicator components of the active substance, it can be qualitatively assessed that at the point of abstraction of surface water for drinking water, concentrations would be expected to be below 0.1 μg/L (the drinking water limit). Consequently, abstracted surface water is unlikely to contain residues that might be changed by water treatment purposes.The PEC in soil, surface water, sediment and groundwater covering the representative uses assessed can be found in Appendix A of this conclusion.The risk assessment was based on the following documents: European Commission (2002a,b, 2014a), SETAC (2001), EFSA (2009, 2013) and EFSA PPR Panel (2013). Some specific aspects related to the environmental risk assessment of aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus were discussed in the Pesticide Peer Review Experts’ Teleconference 25 in March 2020.The information to support the compliance of the batches used in the ecotoxicological studies with the technical specification was considered sufficient.Acute oral toxicity data were available for wild mammals with the representative formulation ‘Problad Plus’. No acute toxicity data for birds were available. Instead, the acute risk was assessed by considering the available information from the literature and the very high margin of safety obtained in the acute risk assessment for mammals. Based on the available information and risk assessments, a low acute risk to birds and mammals was concluded for all the representative spray uses. Appropriate long‐term oral end points were not available for either birds or wild mammals. However, due to the nature of the active substance and its lead component (BLAD protein), the specific mode of action and ready biodegradability of the BLAD protein (see Section 4), the provision of long‐term studies was not required and a low long‐term risk to both birds and mammals was concluded for the representative uses. The risk from secondary poisoning of earthworm‐eating birds and mammals was considered low for all the representative uses. Considering the characteristics of the active substance, bioaccumulation in fish is not expected; therefore, a quantitative risk assessment from exposure via secondary poisoning of fish‐eating birds and mammals was considered unnecessary. A low risk to birds and mammals from consumption of contaminated water was concluded for all the representative uses. Relevant plant metabolites were not identified; therefore, exposure to plant metabolites has not been considered further.Acute data for assessing the oral toxicity of the representative formulation were available for fish (the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss), aquatic invertebrates (the water flea Daphnia magna) and two green algae (Desmodesmus subspicatus and Raphidocelis subcapitata). Chronic toxicity data were available for Daphnia and the representative formulation. Chronic end points for other aquatic organisms were not provided. Based on the available tier 1 data and the characteristics of the active substance, low risk to fish, aquatic invertebrates and algae was concluded for all the representative uses by using FOCUS Step 1–2 exposure estimates. Relevant aquatic metabolites were not identified; therefore, exposure to aquatic metabolites has not been considered further.Appropriate acute and chronic toxicity data on honey bees were available for the formulated product. In addition, studies investigating the chronic oral toxicity of ‘Problad Plus’ to honey bee larvae were available. The risk assessment performed in line with the EFSA bee guidance document (EFSA, 2013) showed a low acute risk to honey bees from contact and oral exposure for all the representative uses (the same conclusion would be reached by applying the guidance document on terrestrial ecotoxicology (European Commission, 2002a)). The risk to honeybee larvae was assessed as low for all uses evaluated. A high chronic risk was indicated in the screening step for all uses. The tier 1 chronic risk assessment resulted in a low risk for the use in tomatoes and in a high risk from exposure to residues from pollen and nectar in the treated crop in strawberries. However, considering the nature of the substance and the foliar degradation of its lead component following application (see Section 3), the chronic risk to honey bees in the treated crop scenario can also be considered as low for the uses in strawberries. The risk from exposure to contaminated surface water was not assessed (data gap). An assessment of accumulative effects was not available. No data were available on sublethal effects, e.g. hypopharyngeal glands (data gap). Toxicity data and risk assessment were not provided for bumblebees or solitary bees.Tier 1 and extended laboratory toxicity tests on the non‐target arthropods, the parasitic wasp Aphidius rhopalosiphi and the predatory mite Typhlodromus pyri, were available with the representative formulation. In addition, an extended laboratory test on the green lacewing Chrysoperla carnea with the representative formulation was submitted. Based on the available data and risk assessment, a low in‐field and off‐field risk to non‐target arthropods was concluded for all the representative uses.Chronic toxicity data with the formulated product were available for earthworms. No effects were observed in this study. Based on the risk assessment, a high chronic risk could not be excluded. However, taking into account the conservativeness in the PECsoil estimation and that the estimated toxicity exposure ratio (TER) value is close to the trigger, a low risk to earthworms is concluded for all the representative uses of ‘Probad Plus’. Data on effects on soil macroorganisms other than earthworms were not required as a low risk to relevant non‐target arthropod species was concluded at Tier 1. A low risk to soil microorganisms was concluded for all the representative uses.A low risk to non‐target terrestrial plants was concluded for all the representative uses. A study was not available for assessing the effects of ‘Probad Plus’ to organisms involved in sewage treatment processes; however, considering the ready biodegradability of the formulated product, a low risk was concluded.With regard to the assessment of the endocrine disruption potential of the aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus for human health, although a complete toxicological data package is not available to assess the endocrine‐disrupting properties (see Section 2), further studies do not appear scientifically necessary considering that the active substance is of botanical nature, naturally occurring with a pesticide non‐toxic mode of action specific to fungi only, the use of lupins in feed and food, the knowledge that the BLAD protein is biodegradable and that the available toxicity studies and public literature do not provide any major toxicological concern (see Section 2).With regard to the assessment of the endocrine‐disrupting potential of the aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus for non‐target organisms, although no (eco)toxicological data are available to assess the endocrine‐disrupting properties, this does not appear scientifically necessary as lupins may be part of the diet of poultry, fish in aquaculture and other terrestrial animals. Furthermore, in the environment, the active substance is constituted by water, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids.Considering the above, it can be concluded that the aqueous extract from the germinated seeds of sweet Lupinus albus does not meet the criteria for endocrine disruption for humans and non‐target organisms according to points 3.6.5 and 3.8.2 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) 2018/6056.This is a list of data gaps identified during the peer review process, including those areas in which a study may have been made available during the peer review process but not considered for procedural reasons (without prejudice to the provisions of Article 56 of the Regulation concerning information on potentially harmful effects).\n\nGLP five‐batch data of the total quinolizidine alkaloids (lupanine, 13α‐OH-lupanine, 13α‐angeloyloxylupanine, lupinine, albine, angustofoline, 13α‐tigloyloxylupanine, α‐isolupanine, tetrahydrohombifoline, multiflorine, sparteine) and a corresponding specification (relevant for all representative uses evaluated;

        "summary": "Pigs at different stages of the production cycle may have to be killed on‐farm for purposes other than slaughter (where slaughter is defined as killing for human consumption) either individually (e.g. severely injured pigs) or on a large scale (e.g. unproductive animals or for disease control reasons). This opinion assessed the risks associated with the on‐farm killing of pigs and included two phases: 1) handling and moving of pigs and 2) killing methods (including restraint). The killing methods were subdivided into four categories: electrical methods, mechanical methods, gas mixture methods and lethal injection. Four welfare consequences to which pigs can be exposed to during on‐farm killing were identified: pain, fear, impeded movement and respiratory distress. Welfare consequences and relevant animal‐based measures were described. In total, 28 hazards were associated with the welfare consequences; majority of the hazards (24) are related to Phase 2 (killing). The main hazards are associated with lack of staff skills and training, and poor‐designed and constructed facilities. Staff was identified as an origin of all hazards, either due to lack of skills needed to perform appropriate killing or due to fatigue. Corrective measures were identified for 25 hazards. Outcome tables linking hazards, welfare consequences, animal‐based measures, hazard origins, preventive and corrective measures were developed and mitigation measures proposed.",
        "full-text": "In 2009, the European Union (EU) adopted Council Regulation (EC) No 1099/2009 ‘on the protection of animals at the time of killing’, which was prepared on the basis of two Scientific Opinions adopted by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2004 and 2006. In 2013, EFSA produced another Scientific Opinion related to this subject.In parallel, since 2005, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has developed two chapters in its Terrestrial Animal Health Code: i) Slaughter of animals (Chapter 7.5), ii) Killing of animals for disease control purposes (Chapter 7.6). OIE has created an ad hoc working group to revise these two chapters.Against this background, the European Commission requested EFSA a Scientific Opinion providing an independent view on the killing of pigs for purposes other than slaughter, which includes: (i) large‐scale killings for diseases control and for other similar situations, like environmental disaster management; and (ii) on‐farm killing of unproductive animals.With specific reference to handling and moving, restraint, killing and unacceptable methods, procedures or practices on welfare grounds, EFSA was asked to: identify the animal welfare hazards present during on‐farm killing and their possible origins in terms of facilities/equipment and staff [Term of Reference (ToR) 1]; define qualitative or measurable criteria to assess performance on animal welfare [animal‐based measures (ABMs) (ToR2); provide preventive and corrective measures (structural or managerial) to address the hazards identified (ToR3); and point out specific hazards related to species or types of animals (e.g. young ones etc.; ToR4). In addition, the European Commission asked EFSA to also provide measures to mitigate the welfare consequences that can be caused by the identified hazards.This Scientific Opinion aims to update the above‐reported EFSA outputs by reviewing the most recent scientific publications and providing the European Commission with a sound scientific basis for future discussions at international level on the welfare of animals in the context of killing for purposes other than slaughter (in which slaughter is defined as killing animals for human consumption).The mandate also requested a list of unacceptable methods, procedures or practices that need to be analysed in terms of the above welfare aspects. It has to be noted that methods, procedures or practices cannot be subjected to a risk assessment procedure if there is no published scientific evidence related to them. Chapter 7.5.10 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code includes a list of several unacceptable practices and the Panel agrees with this list. In addition, the Panel listed some practices that lead to serious welfare concerns during the on‐farm killing of pigs. These practices should be avoided, re‐designed or replaced by other practices, leading to better welfare outcomes. Finally, the Panel provided a list of methods that are highly painful and should never be used on welfare grounds.To address the mandate, two main approaches have been used to develop this Opinion: (i) literature search; followed by (ii) expert opinion through working group (WG) discussion. The literature search was carried out to identify peer‐reviewed scientific evidence providing information on the aspects requested by the ToRs (i.e. description of the processes, and identification of welfare hazards, their origin, preventive and corrective measures, welfare consequences and related animal‐based measures).From the available literature and their own knowledge, the WG experts identified the processes that should be included in the assessment and produced a list of the possible welfare hazards present during each process related to on‐farm killing of pigs. To address the ToRs, the experts identified the origin of each hazard (ToR1) and related preventive and corrective measures (ToR3), along with the possible welfare consequences of the hazards and relevant animal‐based measures (ToR2). Measures to mitigate the welfare consequences were also considered. Specific hazards were identified in relation to particular types of animals (ToR4), for example, the small size of the heart and low resistance around the skin during electrical killing in piglets. In addition, an uncertainty analysis on the hazard identification process was carried out, limited to quantifying the probability of wrongly omitting true hazards (i.e. false negatives) or wrongly including non‐hazards (false positives) in the assessment.The processes assessed in this Opinion are handling and killing methods. The description of the restraint, when it is needed, has been included in the assessment of the relevant killing method.As this opinion will be used by the European Commission to address the OIE standards, more killing methods than those reported in Council Regulation (EC) No 1099/2009 have been considered. However, among the methods that are used worldwide, the following criteria for the selection of those included in this assessment have been applied: (a) all methods with described technical specifications known to the experts, not only those described in Council Regulation (EC) No 1099/2009 and (b) methods currently used for killing of pigs as well as those still in development but likely to become commercially applicable and (c) methods for which the welfare aspects (in terms of welfare hazards, welfare consequences, ABMs, preventive and corrective measures) are described sufficiently in the scientific literature. Applying these criteria, some methods that may be applied worldwide have not been included in the current assessment.The killing methods that have been identified as relevant for pigs can be grouped into four categories: (1) electrical; (2) mechanical; (3) gas mixtures; and (4) lethal injection.In the electrical killing methods, head‐only electrical stunning is followed (or applied at the same time) by application of the electrical current across the chest to span the heart. Mechanical methods include penetrative captive bolt followed by a killing method (pithing, sticking or lethal injection), non‐penetrative captive bolt for piglets, percussive blow to the head followed by a killing method and firearm with free projectile. Gas mixtures include either those administrated in containers or gas‐filled foams. Lethal injection includes anaesthetic drugs that cause rapid loss of consciousness followed by death.In response to ToR 2, four welfare consequences that pigs may experience during on‐farm killing have been identified: impeded movement, pain, fear and respiratory distress.ABMs for the assessment of these welfare consequences have subsequently been identified. However, under certain circumstances, some ABMs cannot be assessed (e.g. ABMs of the state of consciousness during gas mixtures in containers or gas‐filled foam). In this case, important factors such as gas concentration, foam levels and exposure time should be monitored to maximise the chance of sufficient exposure and an adequate stunning. In the killing phase, pigs may experience welfare consequences if hazards occur during restraint (before killing method application), if induction of unconsciousness is not immediate, or if killing is ineffective. Since consciousness is a prerequisite to experience pain and fear during killing, the ABMs of the state of consciousness are assessed during the killing process to identify the possibility that pigs experience pain and fear. These ABMs of the state of consciousness are specific to the killing methods and some of them were proposed in a previous EFSA opinion (EFSA AHAW Panel, 2013). Flowcharts, including ABMs of the state of consciousness to be used for monitoring of killing efficacy, are reproduced in this opinion in order to provide the European Commission with the full welfare assessment at killing.In answering ToR‐1, 28 related hazards to the welfare consequences were identified. All the processes described in this opinion have hazards; regarding the killing methods, some hazards related to the induction phase to unconsciousness (e.g. during exposure to gas mixtures), others to the restraint of pigs (e.g. during electrical and mechanical killing methods). The main hazards are associated with lack of staff skills and training, and poor‐designed and constructed facilities.Animal welfare consequences can be the result of one or more hazards. Exposure to multiple hazards has a cumulative effect on the welfare consequences (e.g. pain due to injury caused during handling and moving will lead to more severe pain during killing). Some hazards are inherent to the killing method and cannot be avoided (e.g. restraining), other hazards originate from suboptimal application of the method, mainly due to unskilled staff (e.g. rough handling, use of wrong parameters e.g. for electrical methods). In fact, staff was identified as one of the origins for all the hazards, in particular related to lack of appropriate skill sets needed to perform the killing or to fatigue.The uncertainty analysis on the set of hazards provided for each process in this opinion revealed that the experts were 95–99% certain that all listed hazards occur during killing of pigs. However, the experts were 95–99% certain that at least one welfare hazard was missing in their assessment. This is due to the lack of documented evidence on all possible variations in the processes and methods being practised (see Interpretation of ToRs on the criteria for selection of killing methods to be included).In response to ToR‐3, preventive and corrective measures for the identified hazards have been identified and described. Some measures apply for a specific hazard; others can apply to multiple hazards (e.g. staff training and rotation). For all the hazards, preventive measures can be put in place with management having a crucial role in prevention. Corrective measures were identified for 25 hazards; when they are not available or feasible to put in place, actions to mitigate the welfare consequences caused by the identified hazards should be put in place.Finally, outcome tables summarising all the mentioned elements requested by the ToRs (identification of welfare hazards, origin, preventive and corrective measures, welfare consequences and related ABMs) have been produced for each phase and killing method to provide an overall outcome, where all retrieved information is presented concisely. Conclusions and recommendations subdivided by phase and specific killing method are provided.To spare pigs from severe welfare consequences, a standard operating procedure (SOP) should include identification of hazards and related welfare consequences using relevant ABMs, as well as preventive and corrective measures at each phase of killing. Training of staff is a key preventive measure to avoid hazards and mitigate welfare consequences. All processes of the killing should be carried out by trained and skilled personnel. Ideally, pigs should be killed in their home pens and carcasses moved for disposal. If movement of pigs is required, the distance from the home pens to the point of killing should be kept to a minimum and the animals should be moved gently. Painful stimuli, such as electric goads and hitting with a stick, must be avoided. Instead, passive stimuli such as flags, paddles and boards should be used. To monitor the efficacy of the killing method, the state of consciousness and death of the animals should be checked at each step – i.e. after stunning, after the application of a killing procedure and before carcass disposal – using the suggested ABMs.This mandate requests EFSA to provide an independent view on the welfare of pigs during killing for purposes other than slaughter. This Scientific Opinion takes the common on‐farm killing practices into account and focuses on the identification of hazards leading to negative animal welfare consequences during the on‐farm killing. The hazards, their origins, preventive and corrective measures, welfare consequences and related animal‐based measures have been identified on the ground of literature search and expert opinion.Not all the methods, procedures and practices for on‐farm killing of pigs used worldwide are documented. Due to the lack of adequate description or scientific validation, a hazard analysis was not carried out for these methods, procedures or practices.Outcome tables have been prepared to summarise the main results of this opinion and include a concise presentation of all retrieved information.\n\n\n\n\nABMs\n\nAnimal‐based measures\n\n\n\n\nAHAW\n\nAnimal Health and Welfare\n\n\n\n\nIP\n\nIntraperitoneal\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nIntravenous\n\n\n\n\nOIE\n\nWorld Organisation for Animal Health\n\n\n\n\nSOP\n\nStandard operating procedures\n\n\n\n\nToR\n\nTerm of reference\n\n\n\n\nWG\n\nworking group\n\n\n"

        "full-text": "The EFSA Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) previously assessed oilseed rape Ms8 × Rf3 × GT73 and its subcombinations Ms8 × GT73 and Rf3 × GT73 according to the scope as defined in the application EFSA‐GMO‐NL‐2009‐75, and was not in the position to complete the safety assessment of products rich in protein, such as rapeseed protein isolates or products of this nature in animal feeding, because of the lack of a 28‐day toxicity study in rodents with the glyphosate oxidoreductase (GOXv247) protein, in line with the applicable guidelines.On 16 November 2018, the European Commission requested the GMO Panel to complement its original scientific opinion on application EFSA‐GMO‐NL‐2009‐75 for the placing on the market of oilseed rape Ms8 × Rf3 × GT73 and its subcombinations Ms8 × GT73 and Rf3 × GT73, for food and feed uses, import and processing, with the exception of isolated seed protein for food (EFSA GMO Panel, 2016), taking into account the additional information submitted by the co‐applicants BASF Agricultural Solutions Belgium NV and Monsanto Company, consisting of a 28‐day toxicity study in mice with the GOXv247 protein.The GMO Panel assessed the supplementary 28‐day toxicity study in mice with the GOXv247 protein up to 1,000 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day. The study was conducted in accordance with OECD TG 407 (OECD, 2008) and with the principles of Good Laboratory Practice. No adverse effects were observed in this study.Taking into account its previous assessment on EFSA‐GMO‐NL‐2009‐75 (EFSA GMO Panel, 2016) and the outcome of the 28‐day toxicity study in mice with the GOXv247 protein provided in this mandate, the GMO Panel, based on a weight of evidence approach, concludes that food and feed containing, consisting and produced from genetically modified oilseed rape Ms8 × Rf3 × GT73 and its sub combinations Ms8 × GT73 and Rf3 × GT73, are as safe as its conventional counterpart, according to the scope as defined in the application EFSA‐GMO‐NL‐2009‐75.To complement the toxicological assessment of the glyphosate oxidoreductase (GOXv247) protein expressed in oilseed rape Ms8 × Rf3 × GT73 and its subcombinations Ms8 × GT73 and Rf3 × GT73, the applicant provided a 28‐day toxicity study in mice on GOXv247 conducted in accordance with OECD TG 407 (OECD, 2008) and to the principles of Good Laboratory Practice.Groups of CD‐1 mice, (16/sex per group), 7 weeks old at the start of dosing were administered by oral gavage respectively: the GOXv247 protein (in water) at a targeted nominal dose of 1,000, 100 or 10 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day (GOXv247 protein groups); or 1,000 mg/kg bw per day of bovine serum albumin (BSA) (control group). The GMO Panel noted that the applicant did not use a control group given the vehicle alone. Based on the comparison between the BSA control and the laboratory historical control data provided by the applicant,1 the GMO Panel considered BSA as an appropriate control in this study.The test substance contained 95% of an Escherichia coli‐produced GOXv247 protein, with a deduced amino acid sequence identical to the GOXv247 protein expressed in oilseed rape GT73 and to the E. coli‐produced GOXv247 protein used in previous safety studies (e.g. acute toxicity test)1; moreover, amino acid sequence analysis of the E. coli‐produced GOXv247 used in this 28‐day toxicity study by mass spectrometry (MS) matched the deduced sequence as defined by the GOXv247 gene. Additional experimental analyses showed that this protein had the expected molecular weight and immunoreactivity to GOXv247 specific antibodies and was not glycosylated. The functional activity of the E. coli‐produced GOXv247 protein used in this study was not tested.In‐life procedures and observations and terminal procedures were conducted in accordance to OECD TG 407 (OECD, 2008), except that a functional observation battery was not performed. There was no indication of neurological effects based on the routine observations of clinical signs in either the 28‐day toxicity study or a previously evaluated acute toxicity study (EFSA 2004). Therefore, the GMO Panel concludes that this deviation from OECD TG 407 (OECD, 2008) does not compromise the safety assessment of the GOXv247 protein.A one‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (factor: dose) was conducted for the two sexes separately; in case a statistically significant dose effect was identified, each of the three dose groups was compared with the control group using Dunnett's test. In addition, and independently from the ANOVA, a two‐sample t‐test was used to compare the high‐dose group with the control group.Based on the results of concentration analysis, the applicant confirmed that the administered doses were 1,000, 100 and 10 mg/kg bw per day. The results of the substance analysis tests indicated that the dosing preparations were homogeneous and exhibited acceptable stability. There was a single death in the high dose female group, which was associated with evidences of a gavage error. Statistically significant increases in body weight gain were noted in males in the low dose group but not at the higher doses, and food consumption was increased in mid‐dose females but not at the high dose; these findings are not considered to be treatment related as they exhibited no dose response.Statistically significant changes were seen in sorbitol dehydrogenase activity levels in serum (reduced in high dose males); absolute thyroid/parathyroid weights (reduced in all female test groups); thymus weights (reduced in high dose females). These findings are within the normal range of variation seen in this strain and age of the mice and are not considered to be adverse. Total white blood cells (WBC) counts were increased in males treated with the high dose, but this was related to 2 out of 16 mice with very high neutrophil counts and are not considered to be treatment related. There were no treatment‐related findings in the gross or microscopic pathology examinations.The GMO Panel concludes that no adverse effects were observed in mice in this 28‐day toxicity study on E. coli‐ produced GOXv247 protein, at gavage doses up to 1,000 mg/kg bw per day.Since the equivalence between the test substance used in the 28‐day toxicity study and the oilseed rape GOXv247 protein was not complete (i.e. functionality of the E. coli‐produced GOXv247 protein was not tested), the GMO Panel followed a weight of evidence approach to address the safety of the GOXv247 protein, considering the various aspects detailed below.\n\n\nUse of urea‐denatured protein as the test substance: The applicant indicates that GOXv247 is a membrane‐bound protein produced in E. coli in an insoluble form as inclusion bodies and, therefore, a solubilisation step is required for its purification. Earlier work with detergent solubilisation produced only a relatively impure (22%) material1. The urea‐based purification process allowed to obtain 95% pure protein and therefore is considered a reasonable and efficient approach to produce an adequate amount of high purity material for the 28‐day study.\n\nFunctional equivalence of the test substance starting material with the plant protein: The E. coli paste (starting material of the GOXv247 used in the 28‐day study) was tested for GOXv247 specific activity and found to show an enzymatic function similar to that of GOXv247 in GT73 seed extracts (specific activity 5.8 vs 6.6 μmol/min per mg protein and similarly specific versus the tested substrates). The presence of GOXv427 active material in the paste consolidates the conclusions on the structural equivalence of the E. coli and plant GOXv247 described above.\n\nRelevance of GOXv247 function in human and animal bodies: The potential for the active GOXv247 protein once ingested to transform a food/feed component or an endogenous molecule into a hazardous compound, or to adversely affect levels of an essential nutrient is considered to be low: \n\nGOXv247 is a membrane‐bound protein, requiring FAD co‐factor and oxygen donors/acceptors for full activity. It is unlikely that suitable conditions consistent with supporting significant GOXv247 activity will be present in the gastrointestinal tract or in the event of absorption.\nMany oxidase and oxido‐reductase enzymes are naturally occurring in mammals. In the tests provided by the applicant, GOXv247 has been shown to have a high substrate specificity for glyphosate and closely related molecules, but not for the tested endogenous amino acids. It is unlikely that ingested GOXv247 will metabolise molecules other than glyphosate in a manner that could not also be performed by endogenous enzymes.\nIngested GOXv247 is likely to be degraded/denatured in the acid environment of the stomach and by enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract. It is unlikely that significant amounts of active GOXv247 will be systemically absorbed. The GOXv247 protein was degraded in the pepsin resistance test in studies provided by the applicant and previously assessed by the GMO Panel.\n\n\nBioinformatic analysis: The potential for the GOXv247 protein to be a toxin has been addressed by in silico comparison with known toxins in the recent updated bioinformatic analysis provided in the context of a renewal application recently adopted by the GMO Panel (EFSA GMO Panel, 2020).\n\nOverall, the GMO Panel also concludes, based on a weight of evidence consideration of the 28‐day toxicity study, molecular characterisation, enzymatic properties and likely degradation on ingestion, that GOXv247 expressed in oilseed rape Ms8 × Rf3 × GT73 and its subcombinations Ms8 × GT73 and Rf3 × GT73 will not cause any adverse effects in animals or humans consuming food and feed containing, consisting and produced from this crop.The 28‐day toxicity study on GOXv247 protein assessed by the GMO Panel did not show adverse effects.Taking into account its previous assessment on EFSA‐GMO‐NL‐2009‐75 (EFSA GMO Panel, 2016) and the outcome of the 28‐day toxicity study in mice with the GOXv247 protein provided in this mandate, the GMO Panel, based on a weight of evidence approach, concludes that food and feed containing, consisting and produced from genetically modified oilseed rape Ms8 × Rf3 × GT73 and its subcombinations Ms8 × GT73 and Rf3 × GT73, are as safe as its conventional counterpart, according to the scope as defined in the application EFSA‐GMO‐NL‐2009‐75.Letter from the European Commission received on 16 November 2018 requesting EFSA to complement its original scientific opinion on oilseed rape Ms8 × Rf3 × GT73 (application EFSA‐GMO‐NL‐2009‐75), including the sub combinations in scope of the application, on the basis of new information received from the applicants, BASF Agricultural Solutions Belgium NV and Monsanto Company.Acknowledgement letter dated 17 December 2018 from EFSA to the European Commission.EFSA requested additional information to the applicant on 21 December 2018.EFSA received additional information from the applicant on 2 August 2019.EFSA requested additional information to the applicant on 31 October 2019.EFSA received additional information from the applicant on 10 January 2020.EFSA requested additional information to the applicant on 12 February 2020.EFSA received additional information from the applicant on 14 April 2020.\n\n\n\n\nBSA\n\nbovine serum albumin\n\n\n\n\nGMO\n\ngenetically modified organism\n\n\n\n\nGMO Panel\n\nEFSA Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nmass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nOECD\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development\n\n\n"

This additive contains 3‐phytase produced by a genetically modified strain of   and it is authorised in its liquid  1000 and solid form  10000 as a feed additive for chickens for fattening, laying hens, chickens reared for laying and for minor poultry species for fattening or reared for laying or for breeding. The   Panel has adopted an opinion regarding the use of this product as a feed additive in pigs for fattening and minor porcine species for growing. In that opinion, the   Panel concluded that the use of the product as a feed additive would raise no concerns for the consumer safety nor for the environment but that the additive should be regarded as a potential respiratory sensitizer. The Panel also concluded that the additive has a potential to be efficacious in improving the phosphorus utilisation in the target species. However, the Panel could not conclude on the safety for the target species due to the limitations identified in the data provided. The applicant has now complemented the information and made it available to the Panel. The tolerance trial was done in weaned piglets in which the animals received up to 10 times the recommended dose of 1,000  /kg feed. The results showed no adverse effects of the phytase on the performance of the animals or on the haematological and biochemical parameters measured in blood. Therefore, the Panel concluded that the additive (3‐phytase  1000 and  10000) is safe for pigs for fattening and minor growing porcine species at the recommended dose of 1,000  /kg feed.",

In those assessments, the applicant provided a combined tolerance and efficacy trial in weaned piglets to support the safety for pigs for fattening and other minor porcine species for growing.7 However and owing to the lack of precise data on the total feed intake of the animals, the FEEDAP Panel could not consider further the study for the assessment and consequently no conclusion could be drawn regarding the safety of the additive for pigs for fattening nor for other minor growing porcine species.The applicant has provided supplementary data regarding the feed intake of the animals under study and the study is presented below.The additive in either form is safe for pigs for fattening and minor growing porcine species at the recommended dose of 1,000 FTU/kg feed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nEvent\n\n\n\n\n12/02/2020\nDossier received by EFSA.

        "summary": "According to Article 12 of Regulation ( ) No 396/2005,   has reviewed the maximum residue levels ( s) currently established at European level for the pesticide active substance 6‐benzyladenine. To assess the occurrence of 6‐benzyladenine residues in plants, processed commodities, rotational crops and livestock,   considered the conclusions derived in the framework of Commission Regulation ( ) No 33/2008, as well as the European authorisations reported by Member States (including the supporting residues data). Based on the assessment of the available data,   proposals were derived and a consumer risk assessment was carried out. All information required by the regulatory framework was present and a risk to consumers was not identified.",
        "full-text": "6‐Benzyladenine was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 June 2011 by Commission Directive 2011/1/EU, and has been deemed to be approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 541/2011.As the active substance was approved after the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 on 2 September 2008, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to provide a reasoned opinion on the review of the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for that active substance in compliance with Article 12(1) of the aforementioned regulation.As the basis for the MRL review, on 12 April 2019, EFSA initiated the collection of data for this active substance. In a first step, Member States were invited to submit by 10 May 2019 their national Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) in a standardised way, in the format of specific GAP forms, allowing the designated rapporteur Member State, Sweden, to identify the critical GAPs in the format of a specific GAP overview file. Subsequently, Member States were requested to provide residue data supporting the critical GAPs, within a period of 1 month, by 21 October 2019. On the basis of all the data submitted by Member States and by the EU Reference Laboratories for Pesticides Residues (EURL), EFSA asked the rapporteur Member State (RMS) to complete the Pesticide Residues Overview File (PROFile) and to prepare a supporting evaluation report. The PROFile and evaluation report, together with Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) calculations and an updated GAP overview file were provided by the RMS to EFSA on 20 December 2019. Subsequently, EFSA performed the completeness check of these documents with the RMS. The outcome of this exercise including the clarifications provided by the RMS, if any, was compiled in the completeness check report.Based on the information provided by the RMS, Member States and the EURL, and taking into account the conclusions derived by EFSA in the framework of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008, EFSA prepared in March 2020 a draft reasoned opinion, which was circulated to Member States and EURL for consultation via a written procedure. Comments received by 29 April 2020 were considered during the finalisation of this reasoned opinion. The following conclusions are derived.The metabolism of 6‐benzyladenine in plant was investigated in primary crops. According to the results of the metabolism studies, the residue definition for enforcement and risk assessment can be proposed as 6‐benzyladenine. No hydrolysis study is available and is not required as no residues are expected in the raw commodities.An analytical method for the enforcement of the proposed residue definition at the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg in high acid and dry matrices is available. Validation of the analytical method in high water matrices is desirable.According to the EURL, 6‐benzyladenine can be monitored in dry commodities with an LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg, and based on validation data, it can also be monitored in high water content and high acid content, as well as high oil content commodities with an LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg.Available residue trials data were considered sufficient to derive MRL proposals as well as risk assessment values for all commodities under evaluation. A no residue situation is expected for all commodities.6‐Benzyladenine is authorised for use on crops that might be fed to livestock. Livestock dietary burden calculations were therefore performed for different groups of livestock according to OECD guidance. Since the calculated dietary burdens for all groups of livestock were found to be below the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg dry matter (DM), further investigation of residues as well as the setting of MRLs in commodities of animal origin is unnecessary.Chronic consumer exposure resulting from the authorised uses reported in the framework of this review was calculated using revision 3.1 of the EFSA PRIMo. The highest chronic exposure represented 2% of the ADI (Dutch toddler). Acute exposure calculations were not carried out because an acute reference dose (ARfD) was not deemed necessary for this active substance.Regulation (EC) No 396/20051 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Regulation’) establishes the rules governing the setting and the review of pesticide maximum residue levels (MRLs) at European level. Article 12(1) of that Regulation stipulates that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) shall provide within 12 months from the date of the inclusion or non‐inclusion of an active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC2 a reasoned opinion on the review of the existing MRLs for that active substance.6‐Benzyladenine was included in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 June 2011 by means of Commission Directive 2011/1/EU3 which has been deemed to be approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/20094, in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/20115, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 541/20116. Therefore, EFSA initiated the review of all existing MRLs for that active substance.By way of background information, in the framework of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008, 6‐benzyladenine was evaluated by the United Kingdom, designated as rapporteur Member State (RMS). Subsequently, a peer review on the initial evaluation of the RMS was conducted by EFSA, leading to the conclusions as set out in the EFSA scientific output (EFSA, 2010). The approval of 6‐benzyladenine is restricted to uses as plant growth regulator.According to the legal provisions, EFSA shall base its reasoned opinion in particular on the relevant assessment report prepared under Directive 91/414/EEC repealed by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. It should be noted, however, that, in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, only a few representative uses are evaluated, whereas MRLs set out in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 should accommodate all uses authorised within the European Union (EU), and uses authorised in third countries that have a significant impact on international trade. The information included in the assessment report prepared under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 is therefore insufficient for the assessment of all existing MRLs for a given active substance.To gain an overview of the pesticide residues data that have been considered for the setting of the existing MRLs, EFSA developed the Pesticide Residues Overview File (PROFile). The PROFile is an inventory of all pesticide residues data relevant to the risk assessment and MRL setting for a given active substance. This includes data on:\n\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in primary crops;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in processed commodities;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in rotational crops;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in livestock commodities;\nthe analytical methods for enforcement of the proposed MRLs.\nAs the basis for the MRL review, on 12 April 2019, EFSA initiated the collection of data for this active substance. In a first step, Member States were invited to submit by 10 May 2019 their Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) that are authorised nationally, in a standardised way, in the format of specific GAP forms. In the framework of this consultation, 18 Member States provided feedback on their national authorisations of 6‐benzyladenine. Based on the GAP data submitted, the designated RMS, Sweden, was asked to identify the critical GAPs to be further considered in the assessment, in the format of a specific GAP overview file. Subsequently, in a second step, Member States were requested to provide residue data supporting the critical GAPs by 21 October 2019.On the basis of all the data submitted by Member States and the EU Reference Laboratories for Pesticides Residues (EURL), EFSA asked Sweden to complete the PROFile and to prepare a supporting evaluation report. The PROFile and the supporting evaluation report, together with the Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) calculations and an updated GAP overview file, were submitted to EFSA on 20 December 2019. Subsequently, EFSA performed the completeness check of these documents with the RMS. The outcome of this exercise including the clarifications provided by the RMS, if any, was compiled in the completeness check report.Considering all the available information, EFSA prepared in March 2020 a draft reasoned opinion, which was circulated to Member States and EURL for commenting via a written procedure. All comments received by 29 April 2020 were considered by EFSA during the finalisation of the reasoned opinion.The evaluation report submitted by the RMS (Sweden, 2019), taking into account also the information provided by Member States during the collection of data (Germany, 2019), and the EURL report on analytical methods (EURL, 2019) are considered as main supporting documents to this reasoned opinion and, thus, made publicly available.In addition, further supporting documents to this reasoned opinion are the completeness check report (EFSA, 2020a) and the Member States consultation report (EFSA, 2020b). These reports are developed to address all issues raised in the course of the review, from the initial completeness check to the reasoned opinion. Furthermore, the exposure calculations for all crops reported in the framework of this review performed using the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) and the PROFile as well as the GAP overview file listing all authorised uses are key supporting documents and made publicly available as background documents to this reasoned opinion. A screenshot of the report sheet of the PRIMo is presented in Appendix Appendix C – Pesticide Residue Intake Model (PRIMo).According to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, EFSA shall provide a reasoned opinion on:\n\nthe inclusion of the active substance in Annex IV to the Regulation, when appropriate;\nthe necessity of setting new MRLs for the active substance or deleting/modifying existing MRLs set out in Annex II or III of the Regulation;\nthe inclusion of the recommended MRLs in Annex II or III to the Regulation;\nthe setting of specific processing factors as referred to in Article 20(2) of the Regulation.\n6‐Benzyladenine is the ISO common name for N6‐benzyladenine (IUPAC).The chemical structure of the active substance and its main metabolite are reported in Appendix F.For 6‐benzyladenine default MRL of 0.01 mg/kg is established according to Art 18(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. Codex maximum residue limits (CXLs) for 6‐benzyladenine are not available. There are no MRL changes occurred since the entry into force of the Regulation mentioned above.For the purpose of this MRL review, all the uses of 6‐benzyladenine currently authorised within the EU as submitted by the Member States during the GAP collection have been reported by the RMS in the GAP overview file. The critical GAPs identified in the GAP overview file were then summarised in the PROFile and considered in the assessment. The details of the authorised critical GAPs for 6‐benzyladenine are given in Appendix Appendix A – Summary of authorised uses considered for the review of MRLs. The RMS did not report any use authorised in third countries that might have a significant impact on international trade.In the framework of the peer review, 6‐benzyladenine was initially assumed to be a naturally occurring plant hormone. As information was found only on similar compounds, but not on 6‐benzyladenine itself, a data gap was set to provide quantitative evidence that 6‐benzyladenine is naturally occurring in edible crops (EFSA, 2010). In the absence of this information, the toxicological reference values were reconsidered and an ADI was established (European Commission, 2011). No further information to support this assumption was received to date.EFSA has based its assessment on the following documents:\n\nthe PROFile submitted by the RMS;\nthe evaluation report accompanying the PROFile (Sweden, 2019);\nthe draft assessment report (DAR) prepared under Council Directive 91/414/EEC (France, 2007);\nthe additional report (AR) and its addenda prepared under Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 (United Kingdom, 2009);\nfinal addendum to the additional report (AR) (United Kingdom, 2010);\nthe conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance 6‐benzyladenine (EFSA, 2010);\nthe review report on 6‐benzyladenine (European Commission, 2011).\nThe assessment is performed in accordance with the legal provisions of the uniform principles for evaluation and authorisation of plant protection products as set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/20117 and the currently applicable guidance documents relevant for the consumer risk assessment of pesticide residues (European Commission, 1997a, 1997b, 1997c, 1997d, e, f, g, 2000, 2010a, 2010b, 2017; OECD, 2011, 2013).More detailed information on the available data and on the conclusions derived by EFSA can be retrieved from the list of end points reported in Appendix B.6‐Benzyladenine is authorised for use on pome fruits that might be fed to livestock. However, the dietary burdens of livestock are not expected to be significant, as residues in the raw commodities are below the LOQ and the processing studies show that only further reduction of residues is expected in processed commodities. Therefore, further investigation of the occurrence of residues in commodities of animal origin is not required and the setting of MRLs in these commodities is not considered necessary.Chronic exposure calculations for all crops reported in the framework of this review were performed using revision 3.1 of the EFSA PRIMo (EFSA, 2018, 2019). Input values for the exposure calculations were derived in compliance with the decision tree reported in Appendix E. Hence, for those commodities where an MRL could be derived by EFSA in the framework of this review, input values were derived according to the internationally agreed methodologies (FAO, 2009). All input values included in the exposure calculations are summarised in Appendix D. Acute exposure calculations were not carried out because an acute reference dose (ARfD) was not deemed necessary for this active substance.The exposure values calculated were compared with the toxicological reference value for 6‐benzyladenine, included in the Review Report (European Commission, 2011). The highest chronic exposure was calculated for the Dutch toddler, representing 2% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI).These calculations indicate that the uses assessed under this review result in a consumer exposure lower than the toxicological reference value. Therefore, these uses are unlikely to pose a risk to consumer's health.The metabolism of 6‐benzyladenine in plant was investigated in primary crops. According to the results of the metabolism studies, the residue definition for enforcement and risk assessment can be proposed as 6‐benzyladenine. No hydrolysis study is available and is not required as no residues are expected in the raw commodities.An analytical method for the enforcement of the proposed residue definition at the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg in high acid and dry matrices is available. Validation of the analytical method in high water matrices is desirable.According to the EURL, 6‐benzyladenine can be monitored in dry commodities with an LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg, and based on validation data, it can also be monitored in high water content and high acid content, as well as high oil content commodities with an LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg.Available residue trials data were considered sufficient to derive MRL proposals as well as risk assessment values for all commodities under evaluation. A no residue situation is expected for all commodities.6‐Benzyladenine is authorised for use on crops that might be fed to livestock. Livestock dietary burden calculations were therefore performed for different groups of livestock according to OECD guidance. Since the calculated dietary burdens for all groups of livestock were found to be below the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg dry matter (DM), further investigation of residues as well as the setting of MRLs in commodities of animal origin is unnecessary.Chronic consumer exposure resulting from the authorised uses reported in the framework of this review was calculated using revision 3.1 of the EFSA PRIMo. The highest chronic exposure represented 2% of the ADI (Dutch toddler). Acute exposure calculations were not carried out because an ARfD was not deemed necessary for this active substance.MRL recommendations were derived in compliance with the decision tree reported in Appendix E of the reasoned opinion (see Table 11). All MRL values listed as ‘Recommended’ in the table are sufficiently supported by data and are therefore proposed for inclusion in Annex II to the Regulation.Minor deficiencies were identified in the assessment, but these deficiencies are not expected to impact either the validity of the MRLs derived or the national authorisations. The following data are therefore considered desirable but not essential:• Full validation of the analytical method for high water commodities according to European Commission Guidance (European Commission, 2010b).\n\n\n\n\na.i.\n\nactive ingredient\n\n\n\na.s. \nactive substance\n\n\n\nADI\n\nacceptable daily intake\n\n\n\n\nAL\n\nany other liquid\n\n\n\n\nAR\n\napplied radioactivity\n\n\n\n\nARfD\n\nacute reference dose\n\n\n\n\nBBCH\n\ngrowth stages of mono‐ and dicotyledonous plants\n\n\n\n\nBVL\n\nBundesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit, Germany\n\n\n\n\nbw\n\nbody weight\n\n\n\n\nCAC\n\nCodex Alimentarius Commission\n\n\n\n\nCAS\n\nChemical Abstract Service\n\n\n\n\nCCPR\n\nCodex Committee on Pesticide Residues\n\n\n\n\nCEN\n\nEuropean Committee for Standardization (Comité Européen de Normalisation)\n\n\n\n\nCF\n\nconversion factor for enforcement residue definition to risk assessment residue definition\n\n\n\n\nCIRCA\n\n(EU) Communication & Information Resource Centre Administrator\n\n\n\n\nCS\n\ncapsule suspension\n\n\n\n\nCV\n\ncoefficient of variation (relative standard deviation)\n\n\n\n\nCXL\n\ncodex maximum residue limit\n\n\n\n\nDALA\n\ndays after last application\n\n\n\n\nDAR\n\ndraft assessment report\n\n\n\n\nDAT\n\ndays after treatment\n\n\n\n\nDB\n\ndietary burden\n\n\n\n\nDM\n\ndry matter\n\n\n\n\nDS\n\npowder for dry seed treatment\n\n\n\n\nDT90\n\nperiod required for 90% dissipation (define method of estimation)\n\n\n\n\nDTU\n\nDanish Technical University\n\n\n\n\nEC\n\nemulsifiable concentrate\n\n\n\n\nEMS\n\nevaluating Member State\n\n\n\n\nEURL\n\nEuropean Union Reference Laboratories for Pesticide Residues (former CRLs)\n\n\n\n\nFAO\n\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n\n\n\n\nFID\n\nflame ionisation detector\n\n\n\n\nFLD\n\nfluorescence detector\n\n\n\n\nFPD\n\nflame photometric detector\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nGC\n\ngas chromatography\n\n\n\n\nGC‐ECD\n\ngas chromatography with electron capture detector\n\n\n\n\nGC‐FID\n\ngas chromatography with flame ionisation detector\n\n\n\n\nGC‐FPD\n\ngas chromatography with flame photometric detector\n\n\n\n\nGC‐MS\n\ngas chromatography with mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nGC‐MS/MS\n\ngas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nGC‐NPD\n\ngas chromatography with nitrogen/phosphorous detector\n\n\n\n\nGCPF\n\nGlobal Crop Protection Federation (formerly International Group of National Associations of Manufacturers of Agrochemical Products;

The Panel considers that the proposed specifications are not supported by an appropriate compositional characterisation and by batch testing.The applicant has provided some information on a history of consumption of Hovenia dulcis fruits and extracts in foods, mainly beverages and food supplements, and in the traditional Chinese medicine in countries in South Asia.The application includes study reports on an acute toxicity study, a bacterial reverse mutation test, an in vivo micronucleus test, a chromosome aberration test and a 90‐day subchronic toxicity study in rats. The genotoxicity studies provided by the applicant do not comply with EFSA Guidance documents, as an in vitro micronucleus test is missing. In addition, the studies provided did not include information that permitted the identification and characterization of the test substance.Consequently, the Panel considers that the provided toxicological study reports are not informative for the assessment of the toxicological properties of the NF and cannot be used to derive safe intake levels for human consumption. Similarly, an unpublished study report on a human trial for 12 weeks did not provide information which would allow to verify that the test item was representative for the NF. Another human trial concerning the effect of a single dose of 2.5 g of the NF on hang‐over symptoms is considered not relevant for the safety assessment of the NF.The Panel concludes that the safety of the NF has not been established.\n\n\nLetter from the European Commission to the European Food Safety Authority with the request for a scientific opinion on the safety of Hovenia dulcis fruit extract as a novel food Ref.

        "summary": "The European Commission asked   for a scientific opinion on the risks for animal and human health related to the presence of glycoalkaloids ( s) in feed and food. This risk assessment covers edible parts of potato plants and other food plants containing  s, in particular, tomato and aubergine. In humans, acute toxic effects of potato  s (α‐solanine and α‐chaconine) include gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. For these effects, the   Panel identified a lowest‐observed‐adverse‐effect level of 1 mg total potato  s/kg body weight (bw) per day as a reference point for the risk characterisation following acute exposure. In humans, no evidence of health problems associated with repeated or long‐term intake of  s via potatoes has been identified. No reference point for chronic exposure could be identified from the experimental animal studies. Occurrence data were available only for α‐solanine and α‐chaconine, mostly for potatoes. The acute dietary exposure to potato  s was estimated using a probabilistic approach and applying processing factors for food. Due to the limited data available, a margin of exposure ( ) approach was applied. The  s for the younger age groups indicate a health concern for the food consumption surveys with the highest mean exposure, as well as for the P95 exposure in all surveys. For adult age groups, the  s indicate a health concern only for the food consumption surveys with the highest P95 exposures. For tomato and aubergine  s, the risk to human health could not be characterised due to the lack of occurrence data and the limited toxicity data. For horses, farm and companion animals, no risk characterisation for potato  s could be performed due to insufficient data on occurrence in feed and on potential adverse effects of  s in these species.

        "full-text": "The European Commission asked EFSA for a scientific opinion on the risks for animal and human health related to the presence of glycoalkaloids (GAs) in feed and food, in particular in potatoes and potato‐derived products. This risk assessment covers edible parts of potato plants and other food plants containing GAs, in particular tomato and aubergine. Non‐edible parts of GA containing plants have not been considered, with the exception of potato sprouts. The Panel developed the draft scientific opinion which underwent a public consultation from 27 February 2020 to 15 April 2020. The comments received and how they were taken into account when finalising the scientific opinion were published in an EFSA Technical Report (EFSA, 2020).GAs are present in many plants of the family of Solanaceae, and contribute to plant resistance against pests and pathogens. GAs are composed of a steroidal aglycone and an oligosaccharide side chain. In commercial potato cultivars (S. tuberosum), the main GAs are α‐chaconine and α‐solanine, consisting of the aglycone solanidine and chacotriose and solatriose as oligosaccharide side chains, respectively. The aubergine fruit (S. melongena) contains primarily the GAs α‐solamargine and α‐solasonine, composed of the aglycone solasodine and chacotriose and solatriose, respectively. In tomato fruit (S. lycopersicum), α‐tomatine and α‐dehydrotomatine are the major GAs, with lycotetraose coupled to the aglycones tomatidine and tomatidenol, respectively.In experimental animals, the potato GAs, α‐solanine and α‐chaconine, show a relatively low oral bioavailability, with differences between species. Hamsters exhibit higher absorption and slower excretion rates for both substances when compared to rats. Due to the limited information, the metabolic profiles of potato GAs in experimental animals could not be characterised.In humans, α‐solanine and α‐chaconine are systemically absorbed following ingestion. For both substances, relatively long serum half‐lives were reported suggesting a possible accumulation. The blood clearance of the respective aglycone solanidine appears to be slow. Accordingly, levels of solanidine were regularly detected in the blood of human volunteers in several studies, suggesting hydrolysis of GAs. No further information is available on metabolism and excretion of potato GAs in humans.There are no toxicokinetic data on tomato and aubergine GAs and their aglycones in experimental animals and humans.In acute oral toxicity studies, no adverse effects of α‐solanine were observed at doses of 250 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day in rats and 1,000 mg/kg bw per day in mice. Reliable data on other potato GAs or tomato and aubergine GAs and their aglycones are missing.In repeated oral dose studies on potato GAs, rodents showed non‐specific effects, such as reduced body weight and relative liver weight with indication of similar potencies of α‐solanine and α‐chaconine. Hamsters exhibited these symptoms after a 5‐day treatment with 100 mg of α‐solanine or α‐ chaconine/kg bw per day, while mice showed these effects after one week of daily treatments with 416.6 mg of α‐solanine or 409 mg of α‐chaconine/kg bw. Solanidine, however, increased the absolute and relative liver weight at 190.9 mg/kg bw per day in mice, suggesting a different effect of the aglycone compared to the GAs.The tomato GA, α‐tomatine, and its aglycone, tomatidine, exerted no effects in rats, when applied at 20 mg/kg bw per day for a period of 200 day. At higher doses, α‐tomatine reduced the cholesterol uptake and increased fecal sterol and coprostanol excretion in hamsters and rats. In mice, a 1‐ to 2‐week treatment with the aubergine GA, α‐solasonine, increased the body weight gain at 424.4 mg/kg bw per day, while its aglycone, solasodine, decreased body weight gain and caused gastric gland degeneration and liver toxicity at 160 mg/kg bw per day.Developmental studies have been performed mainly in hamsters treated with potato GAs and their aglycones for only one day or for a short, very restricted time period during gestation. Outcomes were mainly analysed in late gestational embryos and comprised effects in the central nervous system, predominantly exencephaly, encephalocele and anophthalmia. These malformations occurred at doses of 165 mg/kg bw per day and above for GAs, and of 115 mg/kg bw per day and above for the aglycones. No no‐observed‐adverse‐effect level (NOAEL) or lowest‐observed‐adverse‐effect level (LOAEL) could be identified from these studies. Reduced postnatal survival of pups due to insufficient milk production was reported when pregnant Holtzman rats had been exposed to 3.6 mg of α‐solanine/kg bw per day. Studies on the male fertility in dogs have been performed only with the aubergine aglycone, solasodine. Decreased epididymal weight and cauda epididymal epithelial height, and also an epididymal lumen depleted of sperm occurred in dogs after 80 mg/kg bw per day given for 1 month. Similar effects were observed in Rhesus monkeys exposed to 100 mg/kg bw per day for 5 months.From the limited number of studies available, there was no evidence for genotoxicity of the potato GAs α‐solanine and α‐chaconine, and the aglycone, solanidine, as well as for the aubergine GA, α‐solamargine. However, there is not sufficient information to conclude on the genotoxic potential of these GAs.No long‐term chronic toxicity/carcinogencity study for potato, tomato or aubergine GAs or for the respective aglycones could be identified.In humans, acute toxic effects following ingestion of potato GAs include gastrointestinal symptoms of varying severity such as vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain, which may occur from a total potato GAs (potato TGA) intake of 1 mg/kg bw or more. Further symptoms, including drowsiness, apathy, confusion, weakness, vision disturbances, rapid and weak pulse and low blood pressure, may be the consequence of dehydration following vomiting and diarrhoea.In severe cases, paralysis, respiratory insufficiency, cardiac failure, coma and death have been reported. Doses in the range of 3–6 mg potato TGAs/kg bw are considered to be potentially lethal for humans. Results from limited volunteer studies suggest possible differences in the human population with respect to the individual susceptibility towards adverse effects associated with the intake of potato GAs.Regarding the mode of action, adverse effects of GAs may be due to their ability to complex with membrane 3β‐hydroxy sterols, thereby causing disruption and loss of integrity of cell membranes. After oral exposure, these effects may affect the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract and cause the symptoms observed in intoxicated humans, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.GAs inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and serum butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) by a reversible, competitive mode of action. The relative potency of inhibition of α‐solanine and α‐chaconine appears to be similar. The aglycones exert weak or no inhibitory effects. The excess of acetylcholine at the neuronal and neuromuscular junctions upon inhibition of the enzymes might also contribute to the symptoms described for intoxications with GAs.At high doses, α‐tomatine may form a non‐absorbable complex with cholesterol and other sterols in the enteral lumen which may impair the absorption of cholesterol. As a consequence, blood cholesterol levels were lowered in rodents.The CONTAM Panel considered that the use of rodent data on acute toxicity was not appropriate to establish a reference point for acute exposure to potato GAs in humans. The CONTAM Panel selected the LOAEL of 1 mg potato TGA/kg bw per day as the reference point for acute risk characterisation, based on human data from case reports, outbreaks and studies in volunteers. The available data on acute toxicity were considered insufficient to establish a health‐based guidance value. Instead, the Panel used the margin of exposure (MOE) approach to assess a possible health concern from acute exposure to potato TGAs via food.Assuming the main symptoms to be mainly due to local irritation of the gastrointestinal mucosa rather than inhibition of AChE activity, the Panel considered that the possible inter‐individual variability in toxicodynamics is more relevant than the interindividual variability in toxicokinetics. Accordingly, an MOE higher than 10 indicates that there is no health concern. This MOE of 10 takes into account the extrapolation from a LOAEL to a NOAEL (a factor of 3) and the interindividual variability in toxicodynamics (a factor of 3.2).The experimental data available for repeated dose toxicity are not sufficient to identify a reference point for chronic exposure to potato GAs. In humans, no evidence of health problems associated with repeated or long‐term intake of GAs via potatoes has been identified.Regarding GAs or aglycones occurring in edible parts of food plants other than S. tuberosum, no suitable study for determining a reference point for tomato or aubergine GAs or aglycones was identified.Occurrence data were only available for α‐solanine and α‐chaconine, and mostly for ‘Main‐crop potatoes’ and ‘New potatoes’. Few data were available for processed food. No data on the occurrence of tomato and aubergine GAs and their aglycones were submitted to EFSA.Since the occurrence data on potato GAs did not cover all the food categories containing potatoes in the Consumption Database, it was decided that the best approach for the exposure assessment would be to use the occurrence data in the raw primary commodities (RPC) (main‐crop potatoes and new potatoes) and the RPC Consumption Database. The Panel decided to combine the occurrence of ‘New potatoes’ with that of ‘Main‐crop potatoes’ and the mean upper bound (UB) occurrence (sum of α‐solanine and α‐chaconine) for these two groups was 51.2 mg/kg and the P95 occurrence was 116.8 mg/kg. The minimum and maximum reported concentrations were 1.1 and 276.6 mg/kg, respectively.The acute dietary exposure to potato TGAs was estimated using a probabilistic approach, including only days in which there was consumption of main‐crop potatoes. As no occurrence data were available for GAs in tomato and aubergine, these foods were not included in the exposure assessment.Processing of potatoes has been reported to reduce the content of GAs in the final processed product. In general, and according to the literature, the peeling of potatoes reduced the GA content by 25–75%, boiling in water and blanching of peeled potatoes by 5–65% and frying in oil of peeled potatoes by 20–90%. Microwave and oven baking of unpeeled potatoes may cause a reduction in the GA content by 3–45% and by 20–50%, respectively. No information has been found about the chemical nature of the GA degradation products. For the exposure assessment, processing factors for the major food processing steps, comprising peeling and heat processing (boiling, frying, baking), were applied to the occurrence data as follows: processing factors between 0.25 and 0.75 were attributed to the peeling of potatoes, between 0.1 and 0.8 for frying and deep frying, and between 0.35 and 0.95 for all other cooking methods.Information about the peeling of potatoes was not available in the consumption database, but it was assumed that 90% of the potatoes are consumed as peeled. Where information of the cooking method was not available, a cooking method was randomly attributed to the eating event based on the relative frequency of cooking methods reported.The mean UB exposure to potato TGAs across surveys ranged from 23.3 μg/kg bw per day in adults to 174.0 μg/kg bw per day in toddlers. The 95th percentile exposure ranged from 78.3 μg/kg bw per day in adults to 535.1 μg/kg bw per day in toddlers (up to 822.9 μg/kg bw per day in the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval).Comparing the LOAEL for potato TGAs of 1 mg/kg bw per day with the acute exposure estimates, the MOEs for the younger age groups indicate a health concern for the food consumption surveys with the highest mean exposure, as well as for the P95 exposure in all surveys. For adult age groups, the MOEs indicate a health concern only for the food consumption surveys with the highest P95 exposures.The CONTAM Panel calculated the mean percentage of days with potato consumption across surveys per age group on which the potato TGA intake may be below the MOE of 10. The highest number of survey days with intake of potatoes below the MOE of 10 was estimated for toddlers (56%) followed by children (50%). For the other age groups, the estimated TGA intake was below the MOE of 10 in up to 22–40% of the survey days.For tomato and aubergine GAs, the risk to human health could not be characterised due to the lack of occurrence data in food and the limited information on the adverse effects in experimental animals and humans.The CONTAM Panel considered that the impact of the uncertainties on the risk assessment of acute exposure to potato GAs in food is moderate, and that overall, the identified uncertainties may either cause an over‐ or underestimation of the risk.Information on the toxicokinetics of GAs was limited to ruminants, for which the data suggest an extensive conversion of α‐solanine and α‐chaconine to aglycones in rumen, and a low potential of solanidine to transfer into cows’ milk.No data on the potential adverse effects of potato GAs in horses, companion animals (cats and dogs) or fur animals were identified. Due to an insufficient database on the adverse effects of GAs in ruminants, pigs, poultry, rabbits and fish, an acute reference dose could not be derived.Potatoes are not grown specifically as feed for livestock, but when supply exceeds market requirements for human consumption whole (raw) potatoes may be used as feed for ruminants and pigs. Some by‐products of potato processing and starch extraction are used as feeds for farmed livestock, principally non‐ruminants, and for companion animals.Data on potato GAs in feed were insufficient to perform an exposure assessment.Thus, no risk characterisation could be performed due to insufficient occurrence data of GAs for feed and the lack of, or limited, data on the adverse effects of GAs in farm animals, horses or companion animals.The following needs have been identified to improve the risk assessment for humans and reduce the uncertainties:\n\nResearch on the occurrence of GAs and their aglycones and other potentially toxicologically relevant secondary plant metabolites in the potato cultivars available on the market and on new potato cultivars resulting from breeding experiments.\nOccurrence data on GAs and their aglycones in potato processed products, including foods for infants.\nOccurrence data on GAs and their aglycones in tomato and aubergine and products thereof.\nData on the toxicokinetics of potato, tomato and aubergine GAs and aglycones in experimental animals and humans.\nData on repeated dose toxicity, including reproductive and developmental toxicity of potato, tomato and aubergine GAs and aglycones in experimental animals.\nStudies in humans linking dietary exposure, biomarkers of exposure and adverse effects.\nThe following needs have been identified to improve the risk assessment for farm animals, horses and companion animals and reduce the uncertainties:\n\nOccurrence data on potato GAs and their aglycones in feed.\nStudies on the kinetics and the potential adverse effects from feed material containing GAs of potato GAs in farm animals, horses and companion animals.\nThe CONTAM Panel applied the general principles for the assessment of chemicals in food as described by WHO/International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) (WHO/IPCS, 2009). In addition, EFSA guidances pertaining to risk assessment were followed for the development of the risk assessment when necessary (EFSA, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2010a,b, 2011a,b; EFSA Scientific Committee, 2011, 2012a, b, 2017a, b, c, 2017d).The following needs have been identified to improve the risk assessment for humans and reduce the uncertainties:\n\nResearch on the occurrence of GAs and their aglycones and other potentially toxicologically relevant secondary plant metabolites in the potato cultivars available on the market and on new potato cultivars resulting from breeding experiments.\nOccurrence data on GAs and their aglycones in potato processed products, including foods for infants.\nOccurrence data on GAs and their aglycones in tomato and aubergine and products thereof.\nData on the toxicokinetics of potato, tomato and aubergine GAs and aglycones in experimental animals and humans.\nData on repeated dose toxicity, including reproductive and developmental toxicity of potato, tomato and aubergine GAs and aglycones in experimental animals.\nStudies in humans linking dietary exposure, biomarkers of exposure and adverse effects.\nThe following needs have been identified to improve the risk assessment for farm animals, horses and companion animals and reduce the uncertainties:\n\n\nOccurrence data on potato GAs and their aglycones in feed.\n\nStudies on the kinetics and the potential adverse effects from feed material containing GAs of potato GAs in farm animals, horses and companion animals.\n\n\n\n\nSicherheitsbewertung gentechnisch veränderter Lebensmittel: Glykoalkaloide in transgenen Kartoffeln.

        "summary": "In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, the applicant Syngenta Crop Protection AG submitted a request to the competent national authority in Portugal to set import tolerances for the active substance lufenuron in grapefruits, oranges, limes, pome fruits, peppers, coffee, sugar canes, muscle, fat, liver and kidney on the basis of the authorised uses of lufenuron in Brazil, Chile and Morocco. The data submitted in support of the request were found to be sufficient to derive maximum residue level (MRL) proposals for all commodities under assessment. For oranges, limes, pome fruits, peppers and coffee beans and commodities of animal origin, the submitted data indicated no need to modify the existing EU MRLs. For grapefruits and sugar cane, the residue data indicated that higher MRLs would be needed. Adequate analytical methods for enforcement are available to control the residues of lufenuron in plant and animal matrices. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concluded that the existing EU uses and the authorised uses of lufenuron in Brazil, Chile and Morocco will not result in chronic consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference value. Considering, however, that the estimated exposure is close to the acceptable daily intake (ADI) and in the light of the expiry of the approval of the active substance, EFSA recommends the review of the existing MRLs taking into account that the MRLs based on the EU uses will become obsolete.",
        "full-text": "In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, Syngenta Crop Protection AG submitted an application to the competent national authority in Portugal (evaluating Member State, EMS) to set import tolerances for the active substance lufenuron in various crops and products of animal origin on the basis of authorised uses of lufenuron in Brazil, Chile and Morocco. The EMS drafted an evaluation report in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on 24 May 2019. The EMS proposed to raise MRLs for lufenuron in grapefruits, oranges, limes, coffee beans and sugar canes imported from Brazil, pome fruits imported from Chile, sweet peppers/bell peppers, imported from Morocco. The EMS also assessed the livestock exposure to lufenuron residues from imported commodities or their by‐products and proposed raising of the MRLs in commodities of animal origin.EFSA assessed the application and the evaluation report as required by Article 10 of the MRL regulation. EFSA identified data gaps and points which needed further clarification and were requested from the EMS. On 8 and 19 May 2020, the EMS submitted the requested information in a revised evaluation report, which replaced the previously submitted evaluation report.Based on the conclusions derived by EFSA in the framework of Directive 91/414/EEC, the data evaluated under previous MRL assessments, including the MRL review according to Article 12 of the Regulation (EU) 396/2005 (MRL review) and the additional data provided by the EMS in the framework of this application, the following conclusions are derived.The metabolism of lufenuron in primary crops has been investigated in fruit crops (tomatoes), leafy crops (head cabbage) and pulses and oilseeds (cotton seed). Lufenuron was the major compound in all studies, suggesting that significant degradation does not occur in plants. Studies investigating the effect of processing on the nature of lufenuron (hydrolysis studies) demonstrated that the active substance is hydrolytically stable under the representative conditions.As the authorised uses of lufenuron are on imported crops, investigations of residues in rotational crops are not required.Based on the metabolic pattern identified in metabolism studies and the results of hydrolysis studies, the residue definition for plant products was proposed as ‘lufenuron (any ratio of constituent isomers)’ for enforcement and risk assessment. This residue definition is applicable to primary crops, rotational crops and processed products.EFSA concluded that for the crops assessed in the present application, the metabolism of lufenuron in primary crops and the possible degradation in processed products has been sufficiently addressed and that the previously derived residue definitions are applicable.Sufficiently validated analytical methods based on high‐performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy (HPLC‐MS/MS)) are available to quantify residues of lufenuron in the crops under assessment according to the residue definition for enforcement at the validated limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.01 mg/kg.The available residue trials were sufficient to derive MRL proposals for all crops under assessment on the basis of authorised uses of lufenuron in Brazil, Chile and Morocco. However, for oranges, limes, pome fruits, peppers and coffee beans, the submitted residue data indicated no need to modify the existing EU MRL. For grapefruits and sugar cane, the residue data indicated that higher MRLs would be needed.Specific studies investigating the magnitude of residues of lufenuron in processed oranges were submitted with the present application. Based on these data, processing factors (PFs) were derived for lufenuron in orange juice, dry pulp and oil, which are proposed for the inclusion in Annex VI of Regulation (EU) No 396/2005:\n\n\n–Orange, juice: < 0.03\n\n–Orange/dry pulp: 0.15\n\n–Orange/oil: 24\nAmong the crops under assessment, citrus fruits, apples and sugar canes may be used for feed purposes. Since import of these commodities in Europe is applied for, these crops or their by‐products can enter the EU livestock feed chain. Thus, a potential carry‐over of lufenuron residues into food of animal origin was assessed. The calculated livestock dietary burden exceeded the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg dry matter (DM) for all relevant animal species, but the calculated exposure was significantly lower than the livestock exposure calculated by the JMPR, based on which the existing EU MRLs for lufenuron in commodities of animal origin were recently set. Thus, in the framework of the current assessment, the nature and magnitude of lufenuron residues in livestock was not investigated further. Under the current assessment, the applicant submitted a validated analytical method for the analysis of lufenuron residues in liver and kidney. EFSA concluded that a sufficiently validated enforcement method is available for the determination of lufenuron residues in liver and kidney at the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg.The toxicological profile of lufenuron was assessed in the framework of the EU pesticides peer review under Directive 91/414/EEC and the data were sufficient to derive an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0.015 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day. Setting of an acute reference dose (ARfD) was not deemed necessary.The consumer risk assessment was performed with revision 3.1 of the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo). Considering the toxicological profile of the active substance, a short‐term dietary risk assessment was not necessary.In the framework of the MRL review, a comprehensive long‐term exposure assessment was performed, taking into account the existing uses at EU level and the acceptable codex maximum residue limits (CXLs). EFSA updated the calculation with the relevant supervised trials median residue (STMR) values for the crops under consideration as derived from the residue trials submitted in support of this MRL application. For remaining commodities, the STMR values were available as derived by the JMPR in 2018. The contributions of commodities for which no GAP was reported in the framework of the MRL review were not included in the calculation.The estimated long‐term exposure to lufenuron residues accounted for up to 84% of the ADI (NL toddler). The contribution of residues in the crops for which the raising of the lufenuron MRLs is proposed under the current assessment – grapefruit and sugar canes – individually accounts for less than 1% of the ADI. For the remaining commodities under consideration, the exposure is related to residues from authorised uses and acceptable CXLs.The risk assessment is affected by additional, non‐standard uncertainties resulting from the lack of the following information:\n\nDetailed information on the possible preferential degradation of one of the enantiomers present in the active substance (R/S-enantiomer) leading to a shift of the isomer ratio in treated crops compared to the isomer ratio in the parent compound applied to the crops;\nInformation on the toxicological profile of the individual enantiomers, compared to the toxicological profile of the isomer mixture.\nIt was noted that an MRL on fin fish resulting from the use of lufenuron as a veterinary medicine is laid down in Regulation (EU) No 967/2014. This introduces an additional uncertainty in the exposure assessment for lufenuron as the consumption of fish could not be taken into account in the exposure calculation due to the lack of data from food surveys performed according to the current standard.Based on the consumer exposure assessment, EFSA concludes that the existing EU uses and the authorised uses of lufenuron in Brazil, Chile and Morocco will not result in chronic consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference value (84% of the ADI). Considering, however, that the estimated exposure is close to the ADI and in the light of the expiry of the approval of the active substance, EFSA recommends the review of the existing MRLs taking into account that the MRLs based on the EU uses will become obsolete.EFSA proposes to amend the existing MRLs as reported in the summary table below.Full details of all end points and the consumer risk assessment can be found in Appendices B–D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodea\nCommodity\n\nExisting\nEU MRL\n(mg/kg)\n\n\nProposed\nEU MRL\n(mg/kg)\n\nComment/justification\n\n\n\n\nEnforcement residue definition: Lufenuron (any ratio of constituent isomers)F\n\n\n110010\nGrapefruits\n0.01*\n0.3\n\nThe submitted data are sufficient to derive an import tolerance based on the authorised GAP in Brazil.

Based on the current evaluation, the data gap identified for poultry liver and kidney in the framework of the MRL review has been addressed and the corresponding footnotes can be deleted.The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) received an application to modify the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for lufenuron in grapefruits, oranges, limes, pome fruits, bell peppers, sugar cane, coffee beans and in all products of animal origin, except poultry commodities. The detailed description of the authorised uses of lufenuron on grapefruits, oranges, limes, coffee beans and sugar canes in Brazil, on pome fruits in Chile and on sweet peppers/bell peppers in Morocco, which are the basis for the current MRL application, is reported in Appendix A.Lufenuron is the ISO common name for (RS)‐1‐[2,5‐dichloro‐4‐(1,1,2,3,3,3‐hexafluoropropoxy)phenyl]‐3‐(2,6‐difluorobenzoyl)urea (IUPAC). The chemical structures of the active substance and its main metabolites are reported in Appendix E.Lufenuron was evaluated in the framework of Directive 91/414/EEC1 with Portugal designated as the rapporteur Member State (RMS) for the representative uses as an insecticide on grapes and tomatoes. The draft assessment report (DAR) prepared by the RMS has been peer reviewed by EFSA (EFSA, 2009). Lufenuron was approved2 for restricted indoor use or in outdoor bait stations as an insecticide on 1 January 2010. The approval of the active substance expired on 31 December 2019. As no application for renewal was submitted in the framework of Regulation (EU) 1107/20093 for lufenuron, the substance is no longer approved in the European Union (EU).The EU MRLs for lufenuron are established in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.4 The review of existing MRLs according to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 (MRL review) has been performed (EFSA, 2017) and the proposed modifications have been implemented in the MRL legislation. After completion of the MRL review, for a number of crops and animal commodities, the Codex maximum residue levels (CXLs) have been taken over in the EU MRL legislation.5In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, Syngenta Crop Protection AG submitted an application to the competent national authority in Portugal (evaluating Member State, EMS) to set import tolerances for the active substance lufenuron in various crops and in the products of animal origin in support of the authorised uses of lufenuron in Brazil, Chile and Morocco. The EMS drafted an evaluation report in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to the EFSA on 24 May 2019. The EMS proposed to raise the MRLs for lufenuron in all commodities under consideration.EFSA assessed the application and the evaluation report as required by Article 10 of the MRL regulation and identified data gaps and points which needed further clarification and were requested from the EMS. On 8 and 19 May 2020, the EMS submitted the requested information in a revised evaluation report, which replaced the previously submitted evaluation report (Portugal, 2019).EFSA based its assessment on the evaluation report submitted by the EMS (Portugal, 2019), the draft assessment report (DAR) (Portugal, 2006) prepared under Council Directive 91/414/EEC, the Commission review report on lufenuron (European Commission, 2011), the EFSA conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance lufenuron (EFSA, 2009), the EFSA reasoned opinion on the MRL review (EFSA, 2017), the Scientific report (EFSA, 2019b) and the evaluations of the Joint Meeting on Pesticide residues (JMPR) (FAO, 2015, 2018).For this application, the data requirements established in Regulation (EU) No 544/20116 and the guidance documents applicable at the date of submission of the application to the EMS are applicable (European Commission, 1997a–g, 2000, 2010a,b, 2017; OECD, 2011, 2013). The assessment is performed in accordance with the legal provisions of the Uniform Principles for the Evaluation and the Authorisation of Plant Protection Products adopted by Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/2011.7A selected list of end points of the studies assessed by EFSA in the framework of this MRL application including the end points of relevant studies assessed previously, are presented in Appendix B.The evaluation report submitted by the EMS (Portugal, 2019) and the exposure calculations using the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo) are considered as supporting documents to this reasoned opinion and, thus, are made publicly available as background documents to this reasoned opinion.Among the crops under assessment, citrus fruit, apple and sugar cane by‐products can be used for feed purposes. Since import of these commodities in Europe is applied for, these crops or their by‐products can enter the EU livestock feed chain. Hence, it was necessary to update the previous dietary burden calculation for livestock (EFSA, 2019b) to estimate whether the residues of lufenuron in imported citrus fruits, apples, sugar canes and their by‐products would have an impact on the levels of residues expected in food of animal origin.The input values for the exposure calculations for livestock are presented in Appendix D.1.The results of the dietary burden calculation presented in Appendix B.2. showed that the exposure to lufenuron residues exceeds the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg DM in all species. However, the calculated dietary burdens are significantly lower than the dietary burdens calculated for EU and Australian beef and dairy cattle by the JMPR (FAO, 2018), based on which the existing EU MRLs are currently set.11In the framework of the present assessment, the applicant applied for MRLs in commodities of animal origin which are equal to the existing EU MRLs for lufenuron for all products except muscle. This may be explained by the fact that the current application (2018) was submitted before the implementation of the higher Codex MRLs for lufenuron in animal commodities by Commission Regulation (EU) 2020/856 (EFSA, 2019b). The applicant's higher MRL proposal on bovine, swine, sheep, goat and equine muscle coincides with the proposal for mammalian meat by the JMPR (FAO, 2018). On the basis of the JMPR evaluation, for muscle, a lower MRL was implemented in the EU Regulation as, at EU level, MRLs are established only for muscle (without fat) and not meat (muscle with fat) as done according to the JMPR.EFSA concluded that the existing EU MRLs for lufenuron in animal commodities are sufficient to account for additional lufenuron residues from the intake of treated imported crops. Thus, in the framework of the current assessment, the nature and magnitude of lufenuron residues in animal commodities was not investigated further. EFSA notes that lufenuron is authorised for the uses as a veterinary drug in fin fish, for which an MRL of 1.35 mg/kg is currently established by Regulation (EU) No 967/2014.12In the framework of the current assessment, EFSA requested a method validation package and internal laboratory validation (ILV) data for the monitoring of lufenuron residues in liver and kidney. The EMS submitted the requested information in a revised evaluation report (Portugal, 2019). Analysis of residues of lufenuron is performed by HPLC‐MS/MS. The validated LOQ is at the level of 0.01 mg/kg in both commodities. No confirmatory method was needed as the method is highly selective. EFSA concluded that the analytical method can be considered to be fully validated as enforcement method in terms of specificity, linearity, accuracy and precision based on the provisions of the SANCO/825/00 rev 8.1 guidance document (European Commission, 2010b).It is noted that the available method for the monitoring of residues of lufenuron in liver and kidney is also appropriate for poultry liver and kidney for which footnotes on an analytical method requirement are attached in Regulation (EU) 2020/856. Based on the current evaluation, the data gap identified for poultry liver and kidney in the framework of the MRL review has been addressed and the corresponding footnotes can be deleted.EFSA performed a dietary risk assessment for the agreed residue definitions for risk assessment using revision 3.1 of the EFSA PRIMo (EFSA, 2018, EFSA, 2019a). This exposure assessment model contains food consumption data for different subgroups of the EU population and allows the acute and chronic exposure assessment to be performed in accordance with the internationally agreed methodology for pesticide residues (FAO, 2016).The input values used in the exposure calculations are summarised in Appendix D.2.\nShort‐term (acute) dietary risk assessment\nAcute exposure calculations were not carried out for lufenuron as an acute reference dose (ARfD) was not deemed necessary to be derived for the active substance.\nLong‐term (chronic) dietary risk assessment\nLufenuron is an equimolar mixture of the R‐ and S‐isomer with a chiral centre at the 2‐position of the hexafluoropropoxy side chain. The toxicological studies submitted in the framework of the EU pesticide peer review (EFSA, 2009) which were performed with the isomer mixture allowed to derive an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0.015 mg/kg bw per day.In the framework of the MRL review, a comprehensive long‐term exposure assessment was performed, taking into account the existing uses at EU level and the acceptable CXLs (EFSA, 2017). EFSA updated the calculation with the relevant STMR values in the crops under consideration as derived from the residue trials submitted in support of this MRL application (Portugal, 2019). In addition, STMR values were integrated in the risk assessment that are related to the Codex MRLs taken over to Regulation (EU) 2020/856. Food commodities for which no GAP was reported in the framework of the MRL review (EFSA, 2017) and for which no Codex MRLs were included in the EU MRL legislation were not included in the exposure calculation.The estimated long‐term exposure to lufenuron residues accounted for up to 84% of the ADI (NL toddler). The contribution of residues expected in (i) milk (cattle) is up to 47% of the ADI, (ii) apples are up to 25% of the ADI, (iii) pears are up to 8.7% of the ADI, (iv) oranges are up to 2.4% of the ADI, (v) bovine muscle is up to 7.2% of the ADI, (vi) swine muscle is up to 3.7% of the ADI, (vii) swine fat is up to 1.9% of the ADI and (viii) for all other assessed crops is less than 1% of the ADI. EFSA estimates that the chronic exposure to lufenuron resulting from pesticide use is likely to be 84% of the ADI. The contribution of residues in the crops for which the raising of the lufenuron MRLs is proposed under the current assessment – grapefruit and sugar canes – individually accounts for less than 1% of the ADI.The risk assessment is affected by additional, non‐standard uncertainties resulting from the lack of the following information:\n\nDetailed information on the possible preferential degradation of one of the enantiomers present in the active substance (R/S‐enantiomer) leading to a shift of the isomer ratio in treated crops compared to the isomer ratio in the parent compound applied to the crops;\nInformation on toxicological profile of the individual enantiomers, compared to the toxicological profile of the isomer mixture.\nIt was noted that an MRL on fin fish resulting from the use of lufenuron as a veterinary medicine is laid down in Regulation (EU) No 967/2014. This introduces an additional uncertainty in the exposure assessment for lufenuron as the consumption of fin fish could not be taken into account in the exposure calculation due to the lack of data from food surveys performed according to the current standard.Based on the consumer exposure assessment, EFSA concluded that the exposure related to the existing MRLs and proposed modifications for lufenuron MRLs will not result in long‐term exposure exceeding the toxicological reference value (ADI) established for lufenuron. Considering, however, that the estimated exposure is close to the ADI and in the light of the expiry of the approval of the active substance, EFSA recommends the review of the existing MRLs taking into account that the MRLs based on the EU uses will become obsolete.For further details on the exposure calculations, a screenshot of the report sheet of the PRIMo is presented in Appendix C.The data submitted in support of this MRL application were found to be sufficient to derive MRL proposals for all crops under assessment on the basis of the authorised uses of lufenuron in Brazil, Chile and Morocco. For oranges, limes, pome fruits, peppers and coffee beans, the submitted residue data indicated no need to modify the existing EU MRL. For sugar canes, although residue data indicated a higher MRL would be needed, additional risk management considerations are required to decide whether modification of the MRL is appropriate considering that the MRL in the country of origin is significantly lower than the MRL proposal derived from the residue trials.The livestock exposure to lufenuron residues from the intake of citrus fruits, apples and sugar canes treated according to authorised uses would not require modification of the existing EU MRLs for lufenuron in commodities of animal origin. It is noted that the available method for the monitoring of residues of lufenuron in liver and kidney is also appropriate for poultry liver and kidney for which footnotes on an analytical method requirement are attached in Regulation (EU) 2020/856. Based on the current evaluation, the data gap identified for poultry liver and kidney in the framework of the MRL review has been addressed and the corresponding footnotes can be deleted.EFSA updated the most recent consumer risk assessment for lufenuron and concluded that the residues of lufenuron in crops from the authorised uses of lufenuron in Brazil, Chile and Morocco will not result in chronic consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference value (84% of the ADI). The contribution of residues in the crops for which the raising of the lufenuron MRLs is proposed under the current assessment – grapefruit and sugar canes – individually accounts for less than 1% of the ADI.The risk assessment is affected by additional non‐standard uncertainties related to the lack of information on the toxicity/occurrence of the individual isomers, to the additional exposure to lufenuron residues from fin fish and the forthcoming revision of the MRLs for the EU uses following the expiry of the approval of the active substance.Based on the consumer exposure assessment, EFSA concludes that the existing EU uses and the authorised uses of lufenuron in Brazil, Chile and Morocco will not result in chronic consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference value (84% of the ADI). Considering, however, that the estimated exposure is close to the ADI and in the light of the expiry of the approval of the active substance EFSA recommends the review of the existing MRLs taking into account that the MRLs based on the EU uses will become obsolete.The MRL recommendations are summarised in Appendix B.4.\n\n\n\n\na.s.\n\nactive substance\n\n\n\n\nADI\n\nacceptable daily intake\n\n\n\n\nARfD\n\nacute reference dose\n\n\n\n\nBBCH\n\ngrowth stages of mono‐ and dicotyledonous plants\n\n\n\n\nbw\n\nbody weight\n\n\n\n\nCAC\n\nCodex Alimentarius Commission\n\n\n\n\nCAS\n\nChemical Abstract Service\n\n\n\n\nCCPR\n\nCodex Committee on Pesticide Residues\n\n\n\n\nCF\n\nconversion factor for enforcement to risk assessment residue definition\n\n\n\n\nCIRCA\n\n(EU) Communication & Information Resource Centre Administrator\n\n\n\n\nCV\n\ncoefficient of variation (relative standard deviation)\n\n\n\n\nCXL\n\nCodex maximum residue limit\n\n\n\n\nDAR\n\ndraft assessment report\n\n\n\n\nDAT\n\ndays after treatment\n\n\n\n\nDM\n\ndry matter\n\n\n\n\nDP\n\ndustable powder\n\n\n\n\nDS\n\npowder for dry seed treatment\n\n\n\n\nEC\n\nemulsifiable concentrate\n\n\n\n\nEDI\n\nestimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nEMS\n\nevaluating Member State\n\n\n\n\neq\n\nresidue expressed as a.s. equivalent\n\n\n\n\nEURL\n\nEU Reference Laboratory (former Community Reference Laboratory (CRL))\n\n\n\n\nFAO\n\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nGC\n\ngas chromatography\n\n\n\n\nGC‐MS\n\ngas chromatography with mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nGC‐MS/MS\n\ngas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nGS\n\ngrowth stage\n\n\n\n\nHPLC\n\nhigh‐performance liquid chromatography\n\n\n\n\nHPLC‐MS\n\nhigh‐performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nHPLC‐MS/MS\n\nhigh‐performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nHR\n\nhighest residue\n\n\n\n\nIEDI\n\ninternational estimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nIESTI\n\ninternational estimated short‐term intake\n\n\n\n\nILV\n\nindependent laboratory validation\n\n\n\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organisation for Standardisation\n\n\n\n\nIUPAC\n\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n\n\n\n\nJMPR\n\nJoint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues\n\n\n\n\nLC\n\nliquid chromatography\n\n\n\n\nLOQ\n\nlimit of quantification\n\n\n\n\nMRL\n\nmaximum residue level\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nMember States\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nmass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nMS/MS\n\ntandem mass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nMW\n\nmolecular weight\n\n\n\n\nNEU\n\nnorthern Europe\n\n\n\n\nOECD\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development\n\n\n\n\nPBI\n\nplant back interval\n\n\n\n\nPF\n\nprocessing factor\n\n\n\n\nPHI\n\npreharvest interval\n\n\n\n\nPRIMo\n\n(EFSA) Pesticide Residues Intake Model\n\n\n\n\nQuEChERS\n\nQuick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (analytical method)\n\n\n\n\nRA\n\nrisk assessment\n\n\n\n\nRAC\n\nraw agricultural commodity\n\n\n\n\nRD\n\nresidue definition\n\n\n\n\nRMS\n\nrapporteur Member State\n\n\n\n\nSANCO\n\nDirectorate‐General for Health and Consumers\n\n\n\n\nSC\n\nsuspension concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSEU\n\nsouthern Europe\n\n\n\n\nSL\n\nsoluble concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSP\n\nwater‐soluble powder\n\n\n\n\nSTMR\n\nsupervised trials median residue\n\n\n\n\nTAR\n\ntotal applied radioactivity\n\n\n\n\nTRR\n\ntotal radioactive residue\n\n\n\n\nUV\n\nultraviolet (detector)\n\n\n\n\nWG\n\nwater‐dispersible granule\n\n\n\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n"

        "summary": "According to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, EFSA has reviewed the maximum residue levels (MRLs) currently established at European level for the pesticide active substance   sp. strain DSMZ 13134. To assess the occurrence of   sp. strain DSMZ 13134 residues in plants, processed commodities, rotational crops and livestock, EFSA considered the conclusions derived in the framework of Commission Regulation (EU) No 188/2011, as well as the European authorisations reported by Member States (including the supporting residues data). Based on the assessment of the available data, MRL proposals cannot be derived and are deemed not to be necessary. A consumer risk assessment cannot be performed quantitatively. Although no apparent risk to consumers was identified, some information required by the regulatory framework would still be desirable. The outcome of the assessment was compared to the criteria defined by the European Commission for inclusion of pesticide active substances in Annex IV of the Regulation. A proposal for inclusion of   sp. strain DSMZ 13134 into Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 is derived by EFSA based on the authorised uses of this Art. 12 review.",
        "full-text": "Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 has been approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 on 1 February 2014 by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 829/2013.As the active substance was approved after the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 on 2 September 2008, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to provide a reasoned opinion on the review of the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for that active substance in compliance with Article 12(1) of the aforementioned regulation.As the basis for the MRL review, on 14 August 2019 EFSA initiated the collection of data for this active substance. In a first step, Member States were invited to submit by 13 September 2019 their national Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) in a standardised way, in the format of specific GAP forms, allowing the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS) the Netherlands to identify the critical GAPs in the format of a specific GAP overview file. Subsequently, Member States were requested to provide residue data supporting the critical GAPs, within a period of 1 month, by 5 December 2019. On the basis of all the data submitted by Member States, EFSA asked the RMS to complete the Pesticide Residues Overview File (PROFile) and to prepare a supporting evaluation report. The PROFile and evaluation report, together with an updated GAP overview file were provided by the RMS to EFSA on 20 February 2020. Subsequently, EFSA performed the completeness check of these documents with the RMS. The outcome of this exercise including the clarifications provided by the RMS, if any, was compiled in the completeness check report.Based on the information provided by the RMS, Member States, and taking into account the conclusions derived by EFSA in the framework of Commission Regulation (EU) No 188/2011, EFSA prepared in May 2020 a draft reasoned opinion, which was circulated to Member States for consultation via a written procedure. Comments received by 29 May 2020 were considered during the finalisation of this reasoned opinion. The following conclusions are derived.In conclusion, it remains supported and sustained by this review that Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 is not hazardous to consumers considering new information received on the fact that it produces the siderophore enantio‐pyochelin.The metabolites are not considered hazardous based on the available knowledge. Their respective magnitude in plants, determined according to sufficiently validated methods for their quantification, has not been addressed and it is still considered as desirable to comply with the current data requirements.Considering the authorised uses, no significant levels of viable counts of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 and/or of its metabolites are expected at the time of harvest and consumer exposure can be reasonably assumed to be negligible.The consumer risk assessment with regard to the use of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 according to the authorised uses can be finalised based on expert judgement, considering that the known metabolites have no identified hazardous properties and are also unlikely to be present in significant amounts at the time of harvest.Following the assessment according to the criteria defined by the European Commission for inclusion of pesticide active substances into Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, an inclusion of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 is recommended.Regulation (EC) No 396/20051 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Regulation’) establishes the rules governing the setting and the review of pesticide maximum residue levels (MRLs) at European level. Article 12(1) of that Regulation stipulates that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) shall provide, within 12 months from the date of the inclusion or non‐inclusion of an active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC2 a reasoned opinion on the review of the existing MRLs for that active substance.Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 has been approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/20093 on 1 February 2014 by means of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 829/20134. Therefore, EFSA initiated the review of all existing MRLs for that active substance.By way of background information, in the framework of Commission Regulation (EU) No 188/20115 Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 was evaluated by the Netherlands, designated as rapporteur Member State (RMS). Subsequently, a peer review on the initial evaluation of the RMS was conducted by EFSA, leading to the conclusions as set out in the EFSA scientific output (EFSA, 2012). Furthermore, according to the provisions of the approval regulation, confirmatory information was requested, as regards effects on human health to confirm the absence of an acute intratracheal and intraperitoneal toxicity/infectivity/pathogenicity potential, to be submitted by 31 January 2016 and evaluated by the RMS and EFSA (2017).According to the legal provisions, EFSA shall base its reasoned opinion in particular on the relevant assessment report prepared under Directive 91/414/EEC repealed by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. It should be noted, however, that, in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, only a few representative uses are evaluated, whereas MRLs set out in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 should accommodate all uses authorised within the European Union (EU), and uses authorised in third countries that have a significant impact on international trade. The information included in the assessment report prepared under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 is therefore insufficient for the assessment of all existing MRLs for a given active substance.To gain an overview of the pesticide residues data that have been considered for the setting of the existing MRLs, EFSA developed the Pesticide Residues Overview File (PROFile). The PROFile is an inventory of all pesticide residues data relevant to the risk assessment and MRL setting for a given active substance. This includes data on:\n\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in primary crops;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in processed commodities;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in rotational crops;\nthe nature and magnitude of residues in livestock commodities;\nthe analytical methods for enforcement of the proposed MRLs.\nAs the basis for the MRL review, on 14 August 2019 EFSA initiated the collection of data for this active substance. In a first step, Member States were invited to submit by 13 September 2019 their Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) that are authorised nationally, in a standardised way, in the format of specific GAP forms. In the framework of this consultation 18 Member States provided feedback on their national authorisations of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134. Based on the GAP data submitted, the designated RMS the Netherlands was asked to identify the critical GAPs to be further considered in the assessment, in the format of a specific GAP overview file. Subsequently, in a second step, Member States were requested to provide residue data supporting the critical GAPs by 5 December 2019.On the basis of all the data submitted by Member States, EFSA asked the Netherlands to complete the PROFile and to prepare a supporting evaluation report. The PROFile and the supporting evaluation report, together with an updated GAP overview file, were submitted to EFSA on 20 February 2020. Subsequently, EFSA performed the completeness check of these documents with the RMS. The outcome of this exercise including the clarifications provided by the RMS, if any, was compiled in the completeness check report.Considering all the available information, EFSA prepared in May 2020 a draft reasoned opinion, which was circulated to Member States for commenting via a written procedure. All comments received by 29 May 2020 were considered by EFSA during the finalisation of the reasoned opinion.The evaluation report submitted by the RMS (Netherlands, 2020), taking into account also the information provided by Member States during the collection of data, is considered as main supporting document to this reasoned opinion and, thus, made publicly available. No EURL report on analytical methods was available.In addition, further supporting documents to this reasoned opinion are the completeness check report (EFSA, 2020a) and the Member States consultation report (EFSA, 2020b). These reports are developed to address all issues raised in the course of the review, from the initial completeness check to the reasoned opinion. Furthermore, PROFile and the GAP overview file listing all authorised uses are key supporting documents and made publicly available as background documents to this reasoned opinion.According to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, EFSA shall provide a reasoned opinion on:\n\nthe inclusion of the active substance in Annex IV to the Regulation, when appropriate;\nthe necessity of setting new MRLs for the active substance or deleting/modifying existing MRLs set out in Annex II or III of the Regulation;\nthe inclusion of the recommended MRLs in Annex II or III to the Regulation;\nthe setting of specific processing factors as referred to in Article 20(2) of the Regulation.\nThe general principles for the establishment and update of Annex IV are laid down in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, which requires that for an active substance which shall be included in Annex IV account should be taken of:\n\nthe use of the active substance;\nthe scientific and technical knowledge available;\nthe result of an assessment of any potential risks to consumers with a high intake and high vulnerability and, where appropriate, to animals;\nthe results of any evaluations and decisions to modify the use of plant protection products.\nCriteria for inclusion of active substances into Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 were defined in a guidance document of the European Commission (2015). As outlined in the guidance document, an active substance should comply with one of the following criteria in order to be recommended for inclusion in Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005:\n\nCriterion 1: The active substance is approved as a basic substance under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009;\nCriterion 2: The compound is listed in Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005;\nCriterion 3: The compound has no identified hazardous properties;\nCriterion 4: Natural exposure is higher than the one linked to the use of PPP;\nCriterion 5: No consumer exposure is forecasted linked to the mode of application of the PPP.\nThe reference isolate of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 is deposited at the culture collection of the German Collection of Micro‐organisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ) under the reference number DSMZ 13134. Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 was isolated from soil from a lettuce field in Germany.Uses evaluated comprised fungicide uses for seed treatment on potatoes to control Rhizoctonia solani and Helminthosporium solani as well as outdoor uses on various crops. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of end points in Appendix A.Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 produces four metabolites, referring to pyochelin, indole‐2‐acetic acid, salicylic acid methylether and deferoxamine as reported in the assessment section and Appendix B.For Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 the default MRL of 0.01 mg/kg is established according to Art 18(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. There are no MRL changes since the entry into force of the Regulation mentioned above.For the purpose of this MRL review, all the uses of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 currently authorised within the EU as submitted by the Member States during the GAP collection, have been reported by the RMS in the GAP overview file. The critical GAPs identified in the GAP overview file were subsequently summarised in the PROFile and considered in the assessment. The details of the authorised critical GAPs for Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 are given in Appendix A. The RMS did not report uses authorised in third countries that might have a significant impact on international trade.EFSA has based its assessment on the following documents:\n\nthe PROFile submitted by the RMS;\nthe evaluation report accompanying the PROFile (Netherlands, 2020);\nthe draft assessment report (DAR) and its addenda prepared under Council Directive 91/414/EEC (Netherlands, 2009, 2012);\nthe conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 (EFSA, 2012);\nthe review report on Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 (European Commission, 2018);\nThe assessment is performed in accordance with the legal provisions of the uniform principles for evaluation and authorisation of plant protection products as set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 546/20116 and the currently applicable guidance documents relevant for the consumer risk assessment of pesticide residues (European Commission, 1997a, b, c d, e, f, g, 2000, 2010a, b, 2017; OECD, 2011, 2013).During the peer review, it was concluded that Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 is not toxic and not expected to be pathogenic to humans by the oral route (EFSA, 2012). Furthermore, confirmatory data also demonstrated absence of acute intratracheal toxicity, infectivity and pathogenicity potential of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 (EFSA, 2017).It was further noted during the peer review that Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 produces four metabolites (pyochelin, indole‐2‐acetic acid, salicylic acid methylether, deferoxamine) and that their toxicological profiles are unknown (EFSA, 2012). The peer review however also mentioned that the metabolites detected in the culture filtrate are naturally occurring compounds, of no toxicological concern and that there are no indications that Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 produces toxic metabolites. Furthermore, while these metabolites have been identified in the culture medium, it was concluded that they are unlikely to be present in the product due to removal of the bacteria from the medium (EFSA, 2012; European Commission, 2018).In the review report, the derivation of consumer reference values for Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 was considered as not needed because the metabolites are naturally occurring, of no known toxicological concern and there are no indications that Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 produces toxic metabolites. With regard to residues, a quantitative consumer risk assessment was not deemed necessary, as Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 is not toxic and is not expected to be pathogenic to humans by the oral route (European Commission, 2018).In the identity section of the peer review, it was highlighted that the taxonomy at the time might change following scientific progress and that the identification of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 at strain level is ensured by a ribotyping method. It was highlighted that there is no direct evidence of a relationship to known animal or human pathogens and only distant relationship to some plant pathogens (EFSA, 2012).Additional information was made available during this Art. 12 review regarding the identity of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134. Based on the available data, it can be reasonably assumed that Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 belongs to the species Pseudomonas protegens; however, it was not possible to verify all available whole genome sequencing data (Netherlands, 2020). It is considered desirable that the assignment of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 to this species is confirmed and readily updated in light that the taxonomy evolves in the future.During the peer review, EFSA obtained information concerning the production of different pyochelin isomers by different Pseudomonas species from published studies and identified consequently a data gap regarding information on the stereochemistry of the siderophore pyochelin (EFSA, 2012). This data gap was addressed during this Art. 12 review, where it was demonstrated on a genomic level that Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 produces the siderophore enantio‐pyochelin and not pyochelin which is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Netherlands, 2020).Furthermore, in the literature the siderophore enantio‐pyochelin is not described as a virulence factor or its producers as mammalian pathogens. However, studies in compliance with the current data requirements were not provided to characterise and to assess the toxicology of enantio‐pyochelin. Noting that enantio‐pyochelin producing organisms are ubiquitous in soil as plant growth‐promoting bacteria and that there are no reports indicating that this metabolite represents a virulence factor, it can be concluded that its association is not related to known human pathogens.Since the strain Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 has been confirmed as non‐pathogenic to humans, further data are not deemed necessary whereby a continuously updated body of knowledge following available guidance would be recommended.Classical microbiological methods are available to determine colony forming units (CFUs) of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134. A new and validated method was provided for this Art. 12 review to distinguish Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa which includes a quantitative determination within the defined linear working ranges. However, the specificity of the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method for Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 cannot be determined as no Pseudomonas strains other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa were included in the validation (Netherlands, 2020). Nevertheless, Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 can also be identified by ribotyping (EFSA, 2012).Analytical methods to identify and quantify the known metabolites as mentioned above in plant matrices are not provided. The presence and concentrations in plants of the metabolites produced by Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 after application under GAP relevant conditions are not known.Noting that methods for monitoring are not required at present, sufficiently validated qualitative and quantitative methods for verification of viable counts, for identification and quantification of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 and of its metabolites post application (after treatment) on plant commodities would be considered as desirable for verification purposes in cases of need.The authorised GAPs of this Art. 12 review are not more critical than the representative uses assessed during the peer review (EFSA, 2012). Authorised uses are characterised by seed treatments, soil treatments or local soil treatments (drip irrigation). Applied viable counts of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 are equivalent to those assessed during the peer review. Plant preharvest intervals of 65 days are indicated for several GAPs and where this information was indicated as not applicable, the pre‐harvest time interval for potatoes, yams and Jerusalem artichokes can be anticipated to be around nine weeks after treatment.Concerning residues, it could not be excluded during the peer review that consumers might be exposed to Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 and to its metabolites (EFSA, 2012). During this Art. 12 review, a study on the persistence of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 in the rhizosphere in soil was made available in which barley seeds were treated at a rate of 8 × 10E10 CFU/kg seed under greenhouse conditions which can be considered representative for the authorised uses of this Art. 12 review. Following application, the Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 initially successfully colonised the root and was detected in all root parts. However, it only transiently influenced the composition of indigenous rhizosphere bacteria and did not establish itself as a predominant member of the root community. In the absence of competing microorganisms, in monoxenic cultures, viable counts of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 decreased after 3 weeks. Plants were harvested at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks after planting. The available study demonstrated that Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 could still be detected 4 weeks after planting, however, not any longer after 8 weeks (Netherlands, 2020).Considering the authorised uses and the strain specific information that is available regarding the decrease of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 after application, significant amounts of metabolites are not expected at the time of harvest.Based on expert judgement, the consumer risk assessment can be considered as finalised because the metabolites do not have identified or known hazardous properties and while noting that a verification of the magnitude of residues of the metabolites on plant commodities following application of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 in compliance with the authorised GAPs would be desirable, at the time of harvest significant amounts are not expected.With regard to the five assessment criteria according to the Commission guidance (European Commission, 2015) for potential inclusion of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 in Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, criteria three and five are considered as met for the following reasons:\n\nPseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 is not approved as a basic substance under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009;\nPseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 is not included into Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005;\nPseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 and metabolites of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 have no identified hazardous properties. However, the determination of the concentrations of the residues of metabolites at the time of harvest in the plant commodities according to a sufficiently validated method including a LOQ is still considered as desirable;\nIt has not been demonstrated that Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 and its metabolites were below natural background levels. However, as long as hazardous properties are not identified for Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 and the formed metabolites are not expected in significant amounts at harvest this is not considered as a concern;\nWhile consumer exposure cannot be excluded based on the mode of application of the PPP and therefore criterion 5 is not met in sensu strictu, the consumer exposure to residues of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 and its metabolites following application in accordance with the authorised GAPs can be considered as highly unlikely.\nConsidering the overall assessment of the available data and based on expert judgement, it is proposed to include Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 in Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 since criteria three and five of the guidance document on criteria for the inclusion of active substances into Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 (European Commission, 2015) are considered fulfilled. Therefore, it can be concluded that while criteria 1, 2 and 4 are not applicable or demonstrated, it can be reasonably assumed that the consumer exposure to residues of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 and its metabolites is negligible.The conclusion of the peer review that Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 is not hazardous to humans remains supported and sustained by this review together with the new information received on the fact that it produces the siderophore enantio‐pyochelin.The metabolites are not considered hazardous based on the available knowledge. Their respective magnitude in plants determined according to sufficiently validated methods for their quantification has not been addressed and it is still considered as data requirements.Considering the authorised uses, no significant levels of viable counts of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 and/or of its metabolites are expected at the time of harvest and consumer exposure can be reasonably assumed to be negligible.The consumer risk assessment with regard to the use of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 according to the authorised uses can be finalised based on expert judgement, considering that the known metabolites have no identified hazardous properties and are also unlikely to be present in significant amounts at the time of harvest.Following the assessment according to the criteria defined by the European Commission for inclusion of pesticide active substances into Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 an inclusion of Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 is recommended.\n\n\n\n\na.s.\n\nactive substance\n\n\n\n\nADI\n\nacceptable daily intake\n\n\n\n\nARfD\n\nacute reference dose\n\n\n\n\nBBCH\n\ngrowth stages of mono‐ and dicotyledonous plants\n\n\n\n\nbw\n\nbody weight\n\n\n\n\nCAC\n\nCodex Alimentarius Commission\n\n\n\n\nCAS\n\nChemical Abstract Service\n\n\n\n\nCFU\n\ncolony forming units\n\n\n\n\nCXL\n\ncodex maximum residue limit\n\n\n\n\nDAR\n\ndraft assessment report\n\n\n\n\nDSMZ\n\nGerman Collection of Micro‐organisms and Cell Cultures\n\n\n\n\nEURLs\n\nEuropean Union Reference Laboratories for Pesticide Residues (former CRLs)\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nInChiKey\n\nInternational Chemical Identifier Key\n\n\n\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organisation for Standardization\n\n\n\n\nIUPAC\n\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n\n\n\n\nLOQ\n\nlimit of quantification\n\n\n\n\nMRL\n\nmaximum residue level\n\n\n\n\nOECD\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development\n\n\n\n\nPHI\n\npreharvest interval\n\n\n\n\nPROFile\n\n(EFSA) Pesticide Residues Overview File\n\n\n\n\nqPCR\n\nquantitative polymerase chain reaction\n\n\n\n\nQuEChERS\n\nQuick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (analytical method)\n\n\n\n\nRMS\n\nrapporteur Member State\n\n\n\n\nSANCO\n\nDirectorate‐General for Health and Consumers\n\n\n\n\nSMILES\n\nsimplified molecular‐input line‐entry system\n\n\n\n\nTRR\n\ntotal radioactive residue\n\n\n\n\nWP\n\nwettable powder\n\n\n"

        "summary": "The conclusions of the   following the peer review of the initial risk assessments carried out by the competent authorities of the rapporteur Member State, France, and co‐rapporteur Member State, Latvia, for the pesticide active substance cyazofamid are reported. The context of the peer review was that required by Commission Implementing Regulation ( ) No 844/2012. The conclusions were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of cyazofamid as a fungicide on potato, tomato and cucurbits and were updated for non‐target organisms. The reliable end points, appropriate for use in regulatory risk assessment, are presented. Missing information identified as being required by the regulatory framework is listed. Concerns are identified.",
        "full-text": "Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Regulation’) lays down the procedure for the renewal of the approval of active substances submitted under Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. The list of those substances is established in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 686/2012. Cyazofamid is one of the active substances listed in Regulation (EU) No 686/2012.In accordance with Article 1 of the Regulation, the rapporteur Member State (RMS), France, and co‐rapporteur Member State (co‐RMS), Latvia, received an application from ISK Biosciences Europe N.V. for the renewal of approval of the active substance cyazofamid. Complying with Article 8 of the Regulation, the RMS checked the completeness of the dossier and informed the applicant, the co‐RMS (Latvia), the European Commission and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) about the admissibility.The RMS provided its initial evaluation of the dossier on cyazofamid in the renewal assessment report (RAR), which was received by EFSA on 23 June 2015. In accordance with Article 12 of the Regulation, EFSA distributed the RAR to the Member States and the applicant, ISK Biosciences Europe N.V., for comments on 22 July 2015. EFSA also provided comments. In addition, EFSA conducted a public consultation on the RAR. EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the European Commission on 21 September 2015.Following consideration of the comments received on the RAR, it was concluded that additional information should be requested from the applicant, and that EFSA should conduct an expert consultation in the areas of mammalian toxicology, environmental fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology.In accordance with Article 13(1) of the Regulation, EFSA should adopt a conclusion on whether cyazofamid can be expected to meet the approval criteria provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council.Following the completion of the peer review, EFSA published on 15 June 2016 its conclusion on the pesticide peer review for cyazofamid (EFSA, 2016). The regulatory decision‐making regarding cyazofamid could not be concluded due to certain open issues identified during the discussions at the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed (PAFF Committee), which were considered crucial for taking a final regulatory decision. In particular, studies available only in the original dossier (supporting the first EU review of cyazofamid) were not considered during the peer review because not provided together with the supplementary dossier.In February 2020, the European Commission asked EFSA to update the risk assessment for non‐target arthropods, in particular for predatory mites, using a weight of evidence approach and taking into account all available information in the applicant's dossier including the studies available in the original dossier (supporting the first EU review of cyazofamid) and the supplementary dossier submitted for the renewal of the approval. Risk mitigation measures would be considered, if appropriate. A second expert meeting to discuss the risk assessment for non‐target arthropods was held in May 2020. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of cyazofamid as a fungicide on potato, tomato and cucurbits as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A of this report.Data were submitted to conclude that the uses of cyazofamid according to the representative uses proposed result in a sufficient fungicidal efficacy against the target organisms.A data gap was identified for a more detailed assessment of the literature review for cyazofamid and its relevant metabolites in the residue section, dealing with side effects on health and published within 10 years before the date of submission of the dossier, to be conducted and reported in accordance with EFSA guidance.In the area of identity, physical chemical properties and analytical methods data gaps were identified for a revised technical specification, residue method for the determination of metabolite CCIM in soil, a validation method for surface water and an independent laboratory validation (ILV) for residues in drinking water, methods for monitoring residue in air and body fluids and tissues and also for additional validation data for the residue method in processed commodities.In the mammalian toxicology area, data gaps have been identified with regard to phototoxicity testing, the comparative in vitro metabolism study, the endocrine disruptor potential and the toxicological relevance of some impurities. In addition, data gaps for the metabolite CCIM were identified for the following studies: repeated dose toxicity, mammalian cell mutation and in vitro mutation.In the residue area, data gaps were identified for a complete residue data set on cucumbers (southern outdoor use) and for additional residue trials on melon, respectively, for the southern outdoor use and the glasshouse use. Data gaps were also identified for a storage stability study in high water content commodities (cucurbits) analysing for cyazofamid and CCIM residues, for the magnitude of CCIM residues in cooked vegetables (courgettes) and for the determination of the residues in pollen and bee products for human consumption resulting from residues taken up by honeybees from crops at blossom. The consumer exposure assessment cannot be concluded on considering the identified data gaps, the outstanding data on the toxicity profile of CCIM and the finalisation of the residue definition for processed commodities.The data available on environmental fate and behaviour are sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level for the representative uses, with the exception that information was not available regarding the effect of water treatment processes on the nature of residues that may be present in surface water at the point of abstraction for drinking water purposes. This results in it not being possible to finalise the consumer exposure and risk assessments. The potential for groundwater exposure by cyazofamid and its soil metabolites CCIM, CCIM‐AM and CTCA from the representative uses above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 μg/L was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all nine FOCUS groundwater scenarios.In the ecotoxicology section, several data gaps were identified in the area of bees risk assessment. Further data gaps were identified for addressing the risk posed by the metabolites CCIM and CCIM‐AM to soil macro‐ and microorganisms.Regarding the outcome of the updated peer review of the risk assessment for non‐target arthropods, a data gap for further data on predatory mites to complete the risk assessment was identified. Such data gap results in an assessment not finalised which is relevant for all representative uses. In the case, the use in glasshouses is confirmed to include applications to permanent greenhouses, then the risk for non‐target arthropods for this type of use would be low.Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/20121 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Regulation’) lays down the provisions for the procedure of the renewal of the approval of active substances, submitted under Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/20092.This regulates for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) the procedure for organising the consultation of Member States, the applicant(s) and the public on the initial evaluation provided by the rapporteur Member State (RMS) and/or co‐rapporteur Member State (co‐RMS) in the renewal assessment report (RAR), and the organisation of an expert consultation where appropriate.In accordance with Article 13 of the Regulation, unless formally informed by the European Commission that a conclusion is not necessary, EFSA is required to adopt a conclusion on whether the active substance can be expected to meet the approval criteria provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 within 5 months from the end of the period provided for the submission of written comments, subject to an extension of up to 8 months where additional information is required to be submitted by the applicant(s) in accordance with Article 13(3).In accordance with Article 1 of the Regulation, the RMS, France, and co‐RMS, Latvia, received an application from ISK Biosciences Europe N.V. for the renewal of approval of the active substance cyazofamid. Complying with Article 8 of the Regulation, the RMS checked the completeness of the dossier and informed the applicant, the co‐RMS (Latvia), the European Commission and EFSA about the admissibility.The RMS provided its initial evaluation of the dossier on cyazofamid in the RAR, which was received by EFSA on 23 June 2015 (France, 2015).In accordance with Article 12 of the Regulation, EFSA distributed the RAR to the Member States and the applicant, ISK Biosciences Europe N.V., for consultation and comments on 22 July 2015. EFSA also provided comments. In addition, EFSA conducted a public consultation on the RAR. EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the European Commission on 21 September 2015. At the same time, the collated comments were forwarded to the RMS for compilation and evaluation in the format of a reporting table. The applicant was invited to respond to the comments in column 3 of the reporting table. The comments and the applicant's response were evaluated by the RMS in column 3.The need for expert consultation and the necessity for additional information to be submitted by the applicant in accordance with Article 13(3) of the Regulation were considered in a telephone conference between EFSA, the RMS on 9 November 2015. On the basis of the comments received, the applicant's response to the comments and the RMS's evaluation thereof, it was concluded that additional information should be requested from the applicant, and that EFSA should conduct an expert consultation in the areas of mammalian toxicology, environmental fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology.The outcome of the telephone conference, together with EFSA's further consideration of the comments, is reflected in the conclusions set out in column 4 of the reporting table. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase and which required further consideration, including those issues to be considered in an expert consultation, were compiled by EFSA in the format of an evaluation table.The conclusions arising from the consideration by EFSA, and as appropriate by the RMS, of the points identified in the evaluation table, together with the outcome of the expert consultation and the written consultation on the assessment of additional information, where these took place, were reported in the final column of the evaluation table.A consultation on the conclusions arising from the peer review of the risk assessment took place with Member States via a written procedure in April–May 2016.In February 2020, the European Commission asked EFSA to update the risk assessment for non‐target arthropods, in particular for predatory mites, using a weight of evidence approach and taking into account all available information in the applicant's dossier including the studies available in the original dossier (supporting the first EU review of cyazofamid) and the supplementary dossier submitted for the renewal of the approval. Risk mitigation measures would be considered, if appropriate. A second expert meeting to discuss the risk assessment for non‐target arthropods was held in May 2020.A final consultation on the conclusions arising from the peer review of the risk assessment and the discussion on the risk assessment for non‐target arthropods took place with Member States via a written procedure in July 2020.This conclusion report summarises the outcome of the peer review of the risk assessment of the active substance and the representative formulation, evaluated on the basis of the representative uses of cyazofamid as a fungicide on potato, tomato and cucurbits, as proposed by the applicant. A list of the relevant end points for the active substance and the formulation is provided in Appendix A.In addition, a key supporting document to this conclusion is the peer review report (EFSA, 2020), which is a compilation of the documentation developed to evaluate and address all issues raised in the peer review, from the initial commenting phase to the conclusion. The peer review report comprises the following documents, in which all views expressed during the course of the peer review, including minority views, where applicable, can be found:\n\nthe comments received on the RAR;\nthe reporting table (10 November 2015);\nthe evaluation table (12 May 2016);\nthe report(s) of the scientific consultation with Member State experts (where relevant);\nthe comments received on the assessment of the additional information (where relevant);\nthe comments received on the draft EFSA conclusion (April–May 2016);\nthe comments received on the draft EFSA conclusion (July 2020).\nGiven the importance of the RAR, including its revisions (France, 2016, 2020), and the peer review report, both documents are considered as background documents to this conclusion and thus are made publicly available.It is recommended that this conclusion report and its background documents would not be accepted to support any registration outside the EU for which the applicant has not demonstrated that it has regulatory access to the information on which this conclusion report is based.Cyazofamid is the ISO common name for 4‐chloro‐2‐cyano‐N,N‐dimethyl‐5‐p‐tolylimidazole‐1‐sulfonamide (IUPAC).The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ‘IKF‐916 160SC‐N’ a suspension concentrate (SC) containing 160 g/L cyazofamid.The representative uses evaluated were foliar applications against late blight on potato and tomato and against downy mildew on cucurbits, edible and inedible peel. Full details of the GAPs can be found in the list of end points in Appendix A.Data were submitted to conclude that the uses of cyazofamid according to the representative uses proposed at EU level result in a sufficient fungicidal efficacy against the target organisms, following the guidance document SANCO/10054/2013 ‐ rev. 3 (European Commission, 2013).A data gap has been identified for a more detailed assessment of the literature review for cyazofamid and its relevant metabolites in the residue section, dealing with side effects on health and published within 10 years before the date of submission of the dossier, to be conducted and reported in accordance with EFSA guidance on the submission of scientific peer‐reviewed open literature for the approval of pesticide active substances under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 (EFSA, 2011).The following guidance documents were followed in the production of this conclusion: SANCO/3029/99‐rev. 4 (European Commission, 2000a), SANCO/3030/99‐rev. 4 (European Commission, 2000b), SANCO/10597/2003‐rev. 10.1 (European Commission, 2012) and SANCO/825/00‐rev. 8.1 (European Commission, 2010).The minimum purity of the active substance as manufactured is 935 g/kg. The same reference specification was proposed as for the first approval; however, neither the batch data from industrial scale production nor the quality control (QC) data fully supported the specification. As a consequence, a data gap was identified for an updated specification supported by data. The minimum purity of the technical material in the FAO Specification 653/TC (February 2015) is 935 g/kg.The assessment of the data package revealed no issues that need to be included as critical areas of concern with respect to the identity, physical, chemical and technical properties of cyazofamid or the representative formulation. The main data regarding the identity of cyazofamid and its physical and chemical properties are given in Appendix A.Adequate methods are available for the generation of pre‐approval data required for the risk assessment; however, a data gap was identified for additional validation data for the residue method in processed commodities. Adequate analytical methods are available for the determination of cyazofamid in the technical material and in the representative formulation as well as for the determination of the respective impurities in the technical material.Cyazofamid residues can be monitored in food and feed of plant origin by the QuEChERS method (liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy (LC‐MS/MS)) with limits of quantification (LOQs) of 0.01 mg/kg in all plant commodity groups. An high‐performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy (HPLC‐MS/MS) method also exists with LOQs of 0.01 mg/kg in dry, high water content and high oil content commodities; however, the extraction efficiency was not fully addressed. For products of animal origin, a method of analysis is not required as maximum residue levels (MRLs) are not proposed for animal commodities.Residues of cyazofamid in soil can be monitored by HPLC‐UV with an LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg; however, the residue definition for monitoring in soil was defined as cyazofamid and its metabolite CCIM (see Section 4). As a consequence, a data gap was identified for a method for the determination of CCIM residues in soil. Cyazofamid can be determined in surface water and drinking water by HPLC‐UV with an LOQ of 0.01 μg/L; however, data gaps were identified for the confirmatory method for surface water and for ILV for the method for residues in drinking water. An analytical method for the determination of residues of cyazofamid in air having an LOQ of at least 14 μg/m3 was also identified as a data gap. A data gap was identified for a validated method of analysis in body fluids and tissues.The following guidance documents were followed in the production of this conclusion: SANCO/221/2000‐rev. 10‐final (European Commission, 2003), SANCO/10597/2003‐rev. 10.1 (European Commission, 2012) and Guidance on dermal absorption (EFSA PPR Panel, 2012).Cyazofamid (IKF‐916) was discussed at the Pesticides Peer Review Experts’ Meeting 141 in February 2016.The relevance of some individual impurities in comparison with the toxicological profile of the parent compound has not been fully addressed; therefore, a data gap has been identified to address the relevance of these impurities present in the technical specifications. The analytical profile of the batch used in all the toxicological studies is in compliance with the technical specifications provided.Cyazofamid is rapidly absorbed after oral administration being mostly eliminated with urine and bile within 24 h. More than 90% of active dose is excreted within 48 h of dosing. Low acute toxicity was observed when cyazofamid was administered by the oral, dermal or inhalation routes; no skin irritation or eye irritation and no potential for skin sensitisation were attributed to the active substance. A comparative in vitro metabolism study has not been provided, and therefore, a data gap has been identified. Cyazofamid was classified as ‘probably phototoxic’ in an in vitro Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) phototoxicity study; on the basis of this, photogenotoxicity testing was identified as a data gap, acknowledging that validated test guidelines are not available. The main target organs of cyazofamid are kidney, liver and testes (via dermal route only) in the rat only, whilst no treatment‐related effects were observed up to the highest dose in mice and dogs. The relevant short‐term no adverse effect level (NOAEL) is 29.5 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day from the 90‐day study in rats, based on kidney changes (increase in urinary proteins and urine volume, increased relative kidney weights and increased occurrence of renal basophilic tubules) and increased blood chloride, cholesterol and triglycerides levels. The relevant long‐term NOAEL is 17 mg/kg bw per day from the 2‐year study in rats based on kidney (weight increase, urinary parameters and biochemistry changes) and liver effects (weight increase). Cyazofamid did not present genotoxic potential in vivo and in the overall in vitro studies. No evidence of carcinogenicity was observed in rats or mice. The reproduction, fertility and developmental parameters were not affected by cyazofamid administration. There was no evidence of neurotoxic effects or immunotoxicity induced by cyazofamid treatment in studies provided. Cyazofamid is not classified or proposed to be classified as carcinogenic or toxic for the reproduction category 2 (ECHA, 2015) in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 (harmonised classification supported by the present assessment). No adverse effects that could be related to an endocrine disruptor mode of action were observed. However, considering that a number of parameters (including sperm evaluation, sexual maturation, functional observation battery (FOB) of offspring etc.) were not assessed in the two‐generation study, an endocrine‐disrupting potential of cyazofamid cannot be ruled out in the absence of mechanistic studies, and therefore, a data gap is identified. Acute oral toxicity studies and an in vitro bacterial mutation assay were provided on four cyazofamid metabolites, CCIM, CCIM‐AM, CTCA and DMSA. Amongst all metabolites, CCIM and CTCA were found more acutely toxic than cyazofamid. All the metabolites were considered non‐mutagenic to bacteria under the conditions of the studies. An acute reference dose (ARfD) of 0.2 mg/kg bw on the basis of the higher acute toxicity of CCIM compared to cyazofamid was agreed by JMPR (JMPR, 2015) and also agreed during the Experts’ meeting 141. However, considering that a data gap was identified with regard to the lack of genotoxicity testing (mammalian cell mutation assay, in vitro mutation test using mouse lymphoma L518Y cells) for the metabolite CCIM, EFSA after the expert meeting considered preferable not to set an acute reference dose (ARfD) for CCIM until its genotoxic potential is clarified; the RMS expressed disagreement, considering the information sufficient for setting an ARfD of 0.2 mg/kg bw for CCIM. The lack of specific toxicity data on metabolite CCIM did not allow concluding on the consumer risk assessment of this metabolite relevant for processed commodities (data gap). A mammalian cell mutation assay, an in vitro mutation test using mouse lymphoma L518Y cells and a repeated dose toxicity study for the metabolite CCIM to conclude on the toxicological relevance of CCIM has not been submitted (data gap for these three studies). The acceptable daily intake (ADI) of cyazofamid is 0.17 mg/kg bw per day with no change in the ADI value compare to SANCO/10379/2002‐final (European Commission, 2002c), based on the NOAEL of 17 mg/kg bw per day for kidney and liver effects observed in the 2‐year study in rats and applying an uncertainty factor (UF) of 100. JMPR derived a similar ADI (0.2 mg/kg bw per day) based on the 2‐year toxicity and carcinogenicity study in the rat and applying an uncertainty factor (UF) of 100. The differences between the two values are due to rounding by the JMPR evaluation. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.045 mg/kg bw per day, based on the NOAEL of 29.5 mg/kg bw per day for the kidney and biochemistry changes observed in the 90‐day study in rat and applying a correction factor to account for the limited oral absorption of 15%; in the previous Review Report assessment (European Commission, 2002a), AOEL was set at 0.3 mg/kg bw per day since a standard correction factor of 100 was considered without taking into account the limited oral absorption. An ARfD was not considered necessary, and therefore, it was not allocated for cyazofamid.Based on human skin in vitro dermal absorption study, dermal absorption values for the representative formulation are 0.1% for the concentrate and 3% for the aqueous dilution. To obtain a level of exposure below the AOEL, no personal protective equipment (PPE) is required for operators according to both the German and UK POEM models. The estimated bystander and residential exposure levels were below the AOEL according to the EUROPOEM II data and BfR model. No exceedance of AOEL was anticipated for the unprotected worker wearing adequate work clothing (but no PPE).The assessment in the residue section is based on the European Commission guideline document on MRL setting (European Commission, 2015), the Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) recommendations on livestock burden calculations (JMPR, 2004, 2007) and the OECD publication on MRL calculations (OECD, 2011).Metabolism in primary crops was investigated upon foliar application on fruits (tomato, grapes), leafy crops (lettuce) and root crops (potatoes), using [U‐14C]‐Phenyl‐ and [4‐14C]‐imidazole rings labelled cyazofamid, respectively. Cyazofamid was the major compound of the terminal residues in fruits, lettuce and potato foliage accounting for 58–96% total radioactive residue (TRR) and occurred at a lower proportion in potato tuber (9.5% TRR) where a significant fraction of the total residues was characterised as polar neutral and acidic components (20–44% TRR). CCIM metabolite resulting from the hydrolysis of the sulphonamide group of the parent compound accounted for 3–7.4% TRR in all the edible parts of the crops and also under its conjugated form in grapes only (2.4% TRR). All the other identified metabolites were structurally related to the parent compound and were recovered at negligible levels (< 10% TRR; < 0.01 mg/kg). A significant fraction of the radioactive residues was shown to be incorporated into natural plant constituents (bound residues) mainly in potato tubers (16–54% TRR) and to a minor extend in the other crops (2.6–25% TRR).In a confined rotational crop study, the metabolism of [U‐14C]‐Phenyl and [4‐14C]‐imidazole cyazofamid was investigated in rotated cereals (wheat), leafy vegetables (lettuce) and root vegetables (carrot) after bare soil application at a 1N rate using plant back intervals (PBIs) of 30, 120 and 360 days. The highest TRR values were observed at the 30‐day PBI and decrease substantially by the 120‐day and 365‐day PBIs. Identification of metabolites was not attempted in lettuce and carrot root in view of the low residue levels (< 0.01–0.015 mg eq/kg and < 0.01–0.018 mg eq/kg, respectively). The maximum residue levels accounted for 0.5 mg eq/kg in wheat forage and straw and 0.09 mg eq/kg in wheat grain at the 30‐day PBI. In wheat forage and straw, cyazofamid and their structurally related compounds (CCBA, CCIM, CCIM‐AM) were tentatively identified and each accounted for a level below 0.01 mg/kg whilst the major part of the radioactive residues were characterised as polar fractions. In wheat grain, most of the radioactive residues were found to be incorporated into natural plant constituents. Based on these data, the metabolic pattern of cyazofamid can be considered as similar in primary and in succeeding crops and a specific residue definition for rotational crops is not deemed necessary. Furthermore, in view of the very low residue levels recovered for each individual component and considering also that a situation of crop failure is not relevant for the representative uses, it can reasonably be assumed that cyazofamid residues are not expected to be present in rotational crops, provided that cyazofamid is applied according to the representative uses.Based on the metabolism data in primary and rotational crops, a general residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment for plants is proposed as cyazofamid only.A sufficient number of residue field trials conducted according to the cGAP conditions are available for potatoes, tomatoes and cucumbers (glasshouse), determining residues of parent compound and metabolite CCIM, respectively. Eight residue trials on cucumber (southern outdoor use) are requested with a possible extrapolation to the whole group of cucurbits, edible peel (data gap). For melon, four additional residue trials compliant with the glasshouse use and one additional residue trial compliant with the southern outdoor use are also requested with a possible extrapolation to the whole group of cucurbits, inedible peel (data gap). The results of the residue trials on the crops under consideration are supported by validated analytical methods. Acceptable storage stability study was provided on potatoes and tomatoes and covered the maximum storage period of the residue samples from the trials on these crops. However, based on the current guidance recommendations and considering the results discrepancies observed in the storage stability study submitted on cucumber, cantaloupe and squash compared to the storage stability study on tomatoes, a second storage stability study in high water content commodities (cucurbits) and analysing for cyazofamid and CCIM residues is still needed to confirm the validity of the results of the residue trials on cucumber and melon (data gap).Under standard hydrolysis conditions, cyazofamid was completely degraded into CCIM under baking/brewing/boiling and sterilisation conditions (100% of the applied radioactivity (AR)) and up to 81% of AR under pasteurisation processing. Currently, insufficient specific toxicological data are available to adequately evaluate the relevance of CCIM as a 90‐day rat study is required (see data gaps in Section 2). Furthermore, although this compound was identified at a very low proportion in the primary crop and was not detected in the residue field trials on the crops under consideration, data are available that give the actual occurrence of CCIM in tomato processed commodities. Quantifiable residues of this compound were observed in tomato juice (0.02 mg/kg), tomato paste (0.02–0.05 mg/kg) and tomato ketchup (0.01–0.03 mg/kg). Therefore, CCIM has to be considered relevant for the consumer risk assessment and its inclusion in a separate residue definition for processed commodities is proposed. Thus the finalisation of the residue definition for processed commodities is pending the outcome of the requested toxicological data on CCIM. Furthermore, since CCIM was found to be more acutely toxic than cyazofamid (see Section 2), a data gap was identified to address the occurrence of CCIM in cooked vegetables (courgettes).Although not triggered according to the representative uses, ruminant and poultry metabolism studies were conducted at a dosing rate of 10 mg/kg diet and total residues were shown to be below 0.01 mg/kg in all matrices except in milk, liver and kidney (up to 0.05 mg eq/kg, 0.125 mg eq/kg and 0.1 mg eq/kg, respectively). The parent compound was extensively degraded into numerous minor metabolites and accounted only for a level of < 5% TRR. CCBA (free and cysteine conjugates) was identified as a predominant compound of the total residues in milk (42% TRR), kidney (70% TRR), muscle (24% TRR) and in fat (57% TRR). In muscle and fat and besides the CCBA conjugates, CCIM was also identified predominantly in these matrices (up to 27% TRR and 33% TRR, respectively). In liver, CCIM‐AM and a mixture of conjugates of CHCN and a minor unidentified metabolite were identified each at a level of 12% TRR. Since these studies clearly indicate that residues are not expected in animal matrices based on the calculated dietary burden, EFSA proposes for monitoring and risk assessment to set the residue definition by default as cyazofamid only. No MRLs are required.It is noted that the proposed residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment for primary crops has not been changed compared to the residue definition proposed in the framework of the review of the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for cyazofamid (EFSA, 2012) but has been extended to all categories of crops considering the additional metabolism study on leafy crops submitted for the renewal of the approval of cyazofamid. Since the residue definition for processed commodities cannot be finalised with regard to CCIM in view of the outstanding data regarding the toxicity profile of this compound, it is not excluded that the consumer dietary risk assessment may have to be revised accordingly. Finally, a livestock exposure assessment was also not triggered based on the European authorised uses and the toxicological reference values for cyazofamid remain unchanged. The established MRLs under Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/20053 may therefore need to be revised pending upon the outcome of the outstanding toxicological data on CCIM metabolite.The consumer dietary risk assessment was performed with revision 2 of the EFSA Pesticides Residues Intake Model (PRIMo). No long‐term intake concern was identified (TMDI < 1% ADI, WHO Cluster diet B). No short‐term intake calculation was conducted as an ARfD was not allocated for cyazofamid. The consumer exposure assessment cannot be concluded on considering the outstanding data on the toxicity profile of CCIM and the finalisation of the residue definition for processed commodities.Since all the crops under consideration may be visited by honey bees for pollen and/or nectar collection and considering that application of cyazofamid on the representative crops can take place at flowering, a data gap was identified for the determination of the residues in pollen and bee products for human consumption resulting from residues taken up by honeybees from crops at blossom.Cyazofamid was discussed at the Pesticides Peer Review Expert's teleconference 126 in February 2016.The rates of dissipation and degradation in the environmental matrices investigated were estimated using FOCUS (2006) kinetics guidance. In soil laboratory incubations under aerobic conditions in the dark, cyazofamid exhibited low persistence, forming the major (> 10% applied radioactivity (AR)) CCIM (max. 31% AR), CCIM‐AM (max. 14% AR) and CTCA (max. 21% AR), which exhibited low to moderate, low to high and moderate to high persistence, respectively. Mineralisation of the phenyl and imidazole ring 14C radiolabels to carbon dioxide accounted for 12–14% AR after 45–59 days. The formation of unextractable residues (not extracted by acetonitrile/water followed by sodium chloride solution) for these radiolabels accounted for 48–64% AR at these times. In an anaerobic soil incubation, the route and rate of degradation of cyazofamid were comparable to that which occurred in aerobic incubations. In a laboratory air‐dried soil photolysis experiment the major transformation product CCBA (max. 38–54% AR) was identified in both the light exposed and dark control samples. For the representative uses being assessed, prolonged periods of dry topsoil would not be anticipated, as these crops would all require irrigation in dry periods. So for the representative uses, further assessment of CCBA is considered unnecessary. For other uses where dry soil conditions might be anticipated, additional information to complete exposure assessments for CCBA may be necessary. Cyazofamid exhibited low mobility in soil. CTCA and CCIM exhibited medium to low soil mobility and CCIM‐AM exhibited low to slight soil mobility. It was concluded that the adsorption of all these compounds was not pH dependent. The dossier contains no information from field dissipation studies. Consequently, the available exposure assessment has been completed using the information from just laboratory investigations. Field dissipation and/or degradation time values (or field residue levels should the derivation of reliable kinetics be not possible) for CTCA and CCIM‐AM should have been made available according to the data requirements. As such data were not available; this has been identified as a data gap (see Section 7).In laboratory incubations in dark aerobic natural sediment water systems, cyazofamid exhibited moderate persistence, forming the major metabolites CCIM (max. 28% AR in water and 19% AR in sediment, exhibiting moderate persistence), CCIM‐AM (max. 11% AR as sum of both water and sediment, exhibiting moderate persistence) and CTCA (max. 8% AR in water and 22% max. in sediment, still increasing at study end that also exhibited moderate persistence). The unextractable sediment fraction (not extracted by acetonitrile/water) was a sink for the phenyl and imidazole ring 14C radiolabels, accounting for 45–46% AR at study end (100 days). Mineralisation of these radiolabels accounted for only 0.6–3.2% AR at the end of the study. The rate of decline of cyazofamid in a laboratory sterile aqueous photolysis experiment was more rapid than occurred in the aerobic sediment water incubations. The major transformation products identified were CCIM (max. 40% AR), CCTS (max. 38% AR), HTID (max. 18% AR), p‐toluamide (max. 12% AR) and CDTS (max. 10% AR). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments (predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) calculations) were carried out for the metabolites/phototransformation products CCIM, CCIM‐AM, CTCA, CCTS, CDTS, HTID and p‐toluamide, using the FOCUS (FOCUS, 2001) step 1 and step 2 approach (version 2.1 of the Steps 1–2 in FOCUS calculator). For the active substance cyazofamid, appropriate step 3 (FOCUS, 2001) simulations were available.4 For the phototransformation product CDTS, step 3 results for the active substance precursor were used to calculate exposure assessments for it, considered equivalent to a step 3 assessment.The necessary groundwater exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using FOCUS (FOCUS, 2009) scenarios and the models PEARL 4.4.4 and PELMO 5.5.35 for the active substance cyazofamid and its soil transformation products CCIM, CCIM‐AM and CTCA. The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative uses by cyazofamid and these three transformation products above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 μg/L was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all nine FOCUS groundwater scenarios.The applicant did not provide appropriate information to address the effect of water treatments processes on the nature of the residues that might be present in surface water, when surface water is abstracted for drinking water. This has led to the identification of a data gap (see Section 7) and results in the consumer risk assessment not being finalised (see Section 9).The PEC in soil, surface water, sediment and groundwater covering the representative uses assessed can be found in Appendix A of this conclusion.The risk assessment was based on the following documents: European Commission (2002b,c), SETAC (2001), EFSA (2009), EFSA PPR Panel (2013) and EFSA (2013). According to Regulation (EU) No. 283/20136, data should be provided regarding the acute and chronic toxicity to honeybees and data to address the development of honeybee brood and larvae. As the European Commission (2002b) does not provide a risk assessment scheme which is able to use the chronic toxicity data for adult honeybees and the honeybee brood, when performing the risk assessment according to European Commission (2002b), the risk to adult honeybees from chronic toxicity and the risk to bee brood, could not be finalised due to the lack of a risk assessment scheme. Therefore, the EFSA (2013) was used for risk assessment in order to reach a conclusion for the representative uses.Cyazofamid was discussed at the Pesticide Peer Review Experts’ Meeting 142 in February 2016. A second expert meeting to discuss the risk assessment for non‐target arthropods was held in May 2020.No separate risk assessment was presented for field and protected uses on tomato and cucurbits. Therefore, the present evaluation is focused on the worst case (field uses).As mentioned in Section 2, the relevance of some individual impurities in comparison with the toxicological profile of the parent compound has not been fully addressed (data gap).Based on the available data and risk assessment, a low acute and chronic risk via dietary exposure to birds and wild mammals was concluded for all representative uses of cyazofamid. A low risk was also concluded from secondary poisoning and from exposure via contaminated water.A low risk to all aquatic organisms was concluded for all representative uses of cyazofamid by using PECsw estimated with FOCUS step 1–3. Based on the available data, a low risk was also concluded for the metabolites CCIM, CCIM‐AM, CTCA, CCTS and HTID. No experimental toxicity data were available for the metabolites p‐toluamide and CDTS. The screening assessment carried out considering these metabolites 10 times more toxic than the parent was sufficient to conclude a low risk for all representative uses.The risk assessment to bees was performed by EFSA in accordance with EFSA (2013). Based on the available acute and chronic data, a low risk to adult honeybees could be concluded at the screening level for all representative uses. No standard laboratory data were available for estimating the toxicity of cyazofamid to honeybee larvae. However, a higher tier study (tunnel test) was performed in accordance with the OECD 75 guideline (OECD, 2007). The test was carried out with an application of 256 g cyazofamid/ha (close to 3x single application rate according to the current GAP) on Phacelia. This is regarded as acceptable since the six applications of cyazofamid foreseen for the representative uses are likely to be performed in two blocks of maximum three applications each. Brood termination rate and the foraging activity were significantly decreased with respect to the control. A slight (non‐significant) decrease was also seen for the brood index. The brood compensation index was comparable to the control, giving some indications that the colonies could be able to recover from temporary effect of the test item. However, the number of observations and the length of the study are considered insufficient for concluding a low risk. A data gap is therefore identified.No assessment was available for sublethal effects (i.e. HPG) (data gap). No assessment for accumulative effects was available. No information was available regarding metabolites occurring in pollen and nectar (data gap).A low acute and chronic risk to honeybees was concluded on the basis of the screening assessment for exposure via residues in guttation fluid and surface water. A high margin of safety (three orders of magnitude) was identified. No data were submitted to estimate cyazofamid concentration in puddle water. However, a low risk was also concluded for exposure via residues in puddle water, as the concentration needed to trigger a high risk would have to be three orders of magnitude higher than the solubility limit of cyazofamid. Due to the lack of endpoint for larvae, no risk assessment could be performed for exposure via residues in contaminated water.A tunnel test study similar to the one performed with honeybees was also available for bumblebees. None of the measured endpoint showed appreciable differences between the treated colonies and the controls. However, the number of observations and the length of the study are considered insufficient for concluding a low risk. Furthermore, it was noted that reservoirs of sucrose solution and pollen were made available to the colonies before the exposure phase. It is unclear how this could have influenced the foraging behaviour of the bees, and the consequent exposure to the active substance.No data were available to perform a risk assessment for solitary bees.Regarding the risk assessment for non‐target terrestrial arthropods, standard and extended laboratory data were available for several species. These studies were performed with cyazofamid, the representative product (IKF‐916 160SC‐N) or the representative product used in the previous EU assessment (IKF‐916 400 SC and adjuvant). The experts at the meeting discussed and agreed the scientific validity of the available studies (Pesticides Peer Review TC 147). Several studies were considered not to be reliable as the control performance was not within the expected range or criteria specified in the test guidelines were not fulfilled. It was also discussed whether the data for the representative product used in the previous EU assessment (IKF‐916 400 SC and adjuvant) were comparable to the representative formulation currently under assessment (IKF‐916 160SC‐N). However, as some of the key studies needed for such comparison were not deemed as reliable and those studies which were reliable were not performed to comparable methodologies, it was agreed that no conclusion could be reached (Pesticides Peer Review TC 148).The risk assessment for non‐target arthropods encompasses several steps and an overall weight‐of‐evidence assessment. All aspects of the risk assessment were discussed in detail during the experts meeting. Owing to the lack of reliable toxicity data with either cyazofamid or representative formulation (IKF‐916 160SC‐N), no tier 1 or tier 2 risk assessment could be performed for one of the standard test species (Typhlodromus pyri). The data for the other tested species (Aphidius rhopalosiphi, Chrysoperla carnea and Coccinella septempunctata) indicated a low risk (Pesticides Peer Review TC 149).A field study with predatory mites was available and proposed to be used for a higher tier in‐field risk assessment. The study was discussed at the meeting (Pesticides Peer Review TC 1410). The experts agreed that the study was unreliable and could not be used to draw conclusions on the recovery of non‐target arthropods as the lack of statistical significance was owing to a decrease in the size of the control population and not recovery of the population of mites in the treatment plots. Furthermore, the experts raised concerns regarding the lack of detected effects in the plots treated with reference item which further questions the sensitivity of the test system to be able to properly assess the effects of the test item. No further refinements were available for the in‐field risk assessment.No data were available to perform a higher tier off‐field risk assessment. Furthermore, owing to the lack of reliable tier 1 and tier 2 data for Typhlodromus pyri, it was not possible to quantify the mitigation needed to conclude a low off‐field risk (Pesticides Peer Review TC 1411).The experts at the meeting also constructed a weight‐of‐evidence assessment putting together all of the available evidence to assess whether a low risk to non‐target arthropods could be concluded from either the representative formulation (IKF‐916 160SC‐N) or from cyazofamid. Details of the evidence and the integration of such evidence can be found in the meeting report (Pesticides Peer Review TC 1412). Overall, all the experts agreed that there was insufficient evidence to conclude a low risk to non‐target arthropods from either the representative formulation (IKF‐916 160SC‐N) or from cyazofamid. Therefore, a data gap is identified for further data on predatory mites to address both the in‐field and off‐field risk to non‐target arthropods (relevant to the representative uses to potatoes, tomatoes and cucurbits grown in the field). This also leads to an assessment not finalised for these uses.It is not clear whether the representative uses to tomatoes and cucurbits in glasshouses are restricted to permanent greenhouses. Owing to the lack of exposure, a low risk to non‐target arthropods would be concluded for applications made in permanent greenhouses. For other types of structures, exposure to non‐target arthropods is expected and therefore the above data gap and assessment not finalised are relevant for the representative uses to tomatoes and cucurbits grown in protected structures other than permanent greenhouses.Toxicity data on earthworms and other soil macro‐organisms were available for cyazofamid and the metabolite CTCA. Based on these data, a low risk could be concluded for all representative uses for cyazofamid and the metabolite CTCA. No data were available for the metabolites CCIM‐AM and CCIM. Therefore, a screening risk assessment was carried out assuming the metabolites as 10 times more toxic than the parent. A low risk to both earthworms and other soil macro‐organisms was concluded for CCIM‐AM (all representative uses of cyazofamid) and for CCIM (uses on tomatoes and cucurbits). For CCIM, a low risk to earthworms could not be demonstrated for the representative use of cyazofamid on potatoes (data gap).Toxicity data on soil microorganisms were available for the representative formulation of cyazofamid and the metabolite CTCA. Based on these data, a low risk could be concluded for all representative uses for cyazofamid and the metabolite CTCA. No data were available for the metabolites CCIM‐AM and CCIM (data gap); however, it is likely that these metabolites were formed in the study with the representative formulation.A low risk to non‐target terrestrial plants and biological methods for sewage treatment was concluded for all representative uses.For the ecotoxicological assessments, no other studies were available to address the potential endocrine activity of cyazofamid. Pending on the outcome of the data gap in Section 2, further ecotoxicological tests might be necessary to address the potential endocrine‐disrupting properties of cyazofamid.This is a list of data gaps identified during the peer review process, including those areas in which a study may have been made available during the peer review process but not considered for procedural reasons (without prejudice to the provisions of Article 56 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 concerning information on potentially harmful effects).\n\nUpdated technical specification supported by data (relevant for all representative uses evaluated;

        "summary": "The applicants Syngenta Crop Protection,   Europe Ltd. and Oxon Italia S.p.A. submitted requests to the competent national authority in the Netherlands to evaluate the confirmatory data for chlorothalonil that were identified in the framework of the   review under Article 12 of Regulation ( ) No 396/2005 as not available; in addition, Syngenta and   submitted requests for modifications of existing  s. Considering the recent decision on the non‐approval of chlorothalonil, the requests for amending existing  s to reflect intended   uses for chlorothalonil and confirmatory data for   uses became obsolete.   focused therefore its assessment on the import tolerances and on general information on the analytical method required to enforce legal limits for chlorothalonil and its metabolite  ‐3701 (R182281). Analytical methods for enforcement are available to control the residues of chlorothalonil and  ‐3701 in plant matrices at the validated   of 0.01 mg/kg; data on the extraction efficiency for high oil content matrices as requested in the   review were not provided. This data gap is relevant for the import tolerance for peanuts. The data submitted in support of import tolerances were found to be sufficient to derive   proposals for chlorothalonil and  ‐3701 for bagged bananas, papayas and peanuts. Studies investigating the effect of high temperature processing on the magnitude of  ‐3701 in processed products are not available. Based on exposure calculations for chlorothalonil,   concluded that the long‐term intake of residues resulting from the use of chlorothalonil according to the reported agricultural practices is unlikely to present a risk to consumers. For papaya, an acute intake concern was noted for chlorothalonil, while for banana and peanuts, the expected short‐term intake of chlorothalonil residues was below the toxicological reference value. For the metabolite  ‐3701, the toxicological profile is not fully elucidated, and therefore, toxicological reference values could not be derived. Hence, for this metabolite, the consumer risk assessment cannot be finalised.",
        "full-text": "In 2012, when the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reviewed the existing Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) for chlorothalonil according to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, EFSA identified some information as unavailable (data gaps) and derived tentative MRLs for those uses which were not fully supported by data but for which no risk to consumers was identified. The following data gaps were noted which are considered relevant for the current assessment:\n\n\na)for the finalisation of the risk assessment of SDS‐3701: \n\nA validated method for enforcement of metabolite SDS‐3701 in plant commodities, including processed fractions;\nA complete set of residue trials compliant with available guidance documents and allowing for the estimation of SDS‐3701 levels in all crops supported in the framework of this review;\nStorage stability studies demonstrating the stability of SDS‐3701 in plant commodities, including processed fractions;\nFurther information on the magnitude of SDS‐3701 in processed commodities that have been subject to high temperatures;\nA study investigating metabolism of chlorothalonil and metabolite SDS‐3701 in pigs;\nFurther characterisation of the total radioactive residue (TRR) in poultry commodities (if the dietary burden increases in the future).\n\n\nb)for the parent chlorothalonil: \n\nAn analytical method, its ILV and a confirmatory method fully validated for the determination of parent chlorothalonil in hops;\nA storage stability study for parent chlorothalonil in high acid content commodities;\nEight residue trials on apples and pears (with a minimum of four trials on apples) complying with the southern outdoor good agricultural practices (GAPs) for apples, quinces, medlars and loquats;\nFour residue trials on apricots and four residue trials on peaches complying with the southern outdoor GAP;\nFour residue trials on turnips complying with the southern outdoor GAP;\nEight residue trials on head cabbage complying with the northern outdoor GAP;\nEight residue trials on leek complying with the northern outdoor GAP;\nFour additional trials on fresh peas (without pods) complying with the southern outdoor GAP;\nFour residue trials on hops complying with the northern outdoor GAP.\n\nTentative MRL proposals for chlorothalonil have been implemented in the MRL legislation by Commission Regulation (EU) No 1146/2014, including footnotes related to data gaps number 1–15 referred to above, indicating the type of confirmatory data that should be provided by a party having an interest in maintaining the proposed tentative MRL by 29 October 2016. Considering the data gaps identified, MRL proposals for the metabolite SDS‐3701 could not be derived, and consequently, no specific MRLs for SDS‐3701 have been implemented in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.In accordance with the agreed procedure set out in the working document SANTE/10235/2016, the applicants Syngenta Crop Protection, UPL Europe Ltd. (formerly Arysta LifeScience SAS) and Oxon Italia S.p.A (members of Chlorothalonil Task Force) submitted applications to the competent national authority in the Netherlands (rapporteur Member State, RMS) providing confirmatory data identified during the MRL review for a wide range of crops. In addition, applications for modifications of some of the existing MRLs were submitted reflecting intended modifications of the EU use patterns by Syngenta Crop Protection and UPL Europe Ltd. (formerly Arysta LifeScience SAS).The RMS assessed the new information in an evaluation report, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on 26 April 2018.When assessing the evaluation report, EFSA identified points which needed further clarifications. On 16 January 2020, the EMS submitted a revised evaluation report which addressed the points for clarification.It is noted that on 29 April 2019, a decision on the non‐renewal of the approval of chlorothalonil under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 was taken, because of concerns – amongst other concerns – regarding the dietary consumer risk assessment. The toxicological profile of certain metabolites/degradation products (i.e. SDS‐3701 (R182281), R613636 and R417888) was not fully elucidated and, consequently, definitive residue definitions for risk assessment in plant and animal commodities could not be derived by EFSA in previous assessments. Hence, a comprehensive risks assessment cannot be performed.Following the decision on the non‐renewal of the approval, the EU uses of plant protection products containing chlorothalonil had to been withdrawn by 20 November 2019 (period of grace according to Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009: 20 May 2020). Considering the new situation for EU authorisations, data gaps identified in the MRL review related to the EU uses became obsolete (i.e. data gaps 7 and 9 to 15 and eventually data gaps 2 and 4 to 6).The submitted applications of Syngenta Crop Protection and UPL Europe Ltd. (formerly Arysta LifeScience SAS) for new EU uses of chlorothalonil also became obsolete.In the current assessment, EFSA therefore focused on the import tolerance requests and the generic data gap on analytical method, storage stability and the data gap on the magnitude of SDS‐3701 in processed commodities that have been subject to high temperatures, which are also relevant for the import tolerance requests. In addition, EFSA re‐evaluated whether metabolism studies in pigs and data to characterise the TRR in poultry commodities are still required, considering the import tolerances for crops that are used as feed items. It should be highlighted that the current assessment was not an assessment of data gaps identified in the renewal process.Based on the data available, the following conclusions were derived:Analytical methods for enforcement are available to control the residues of chlorothalonil and SDS‐3701 in plant matrices at or above the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg; however, further data on the extraction efficiency for SDS‐3701 are still required for high oil content matrices. Hence, data gap number 1 was partially addressed; for peanuts, the enforcement method for the determination of SDS‐3701 is not fully compliant with the data requirements.Studies investigating the storage stability of chlorothalonil and SDS‐3701 in high acid content commodities were assessed in the framework of the renewal of chlorothalonil. The data gaps number 3 and 8 were sufficiently addressed.The following provisional residue definitions for enforcement and risk assessment were previously derived for plant commodities (MRL review):Residue definition 1: chlorothalonil;Residue definition 2: R182281 (SDS‐3701);In Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, currently the residue definition for plant commodities is only parent chlorothalonil. Since no data on the residue levels expected for SDS‐3701 were available at the time of the MRL review, residue definition 2 has not been implemented in the EU MRL legislation.The current EU residue definitions may need to be revised, taking into account the considerations of the renewal process.To address data gap number 2, residue data were provided for bananas, papayas and peanuts. EFSA concluded that the available residue trials in bagged bananas are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 0.02* mg/kg for chlorothalonil and 0.01* mg/kg for SDS‐3701 for the reported Latin American GAPs. It is noted that EFSA received authorised labels for banana in Latin American countries; however, the conditions of use did not match with the GAP assessed in this reasoned Opinion.The available trials are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 15 mg/kg for chlorothalonil and 0.02 mg/kg for SDS‐3701 on papaya in support of the authorised Brazilian GAP.The available trials are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 0.01* mg/kg for chlorothalonil and SDS‐3701 on peanuts in support of the authorised US GAP.Processing studies to investigate the impact of high temperature treatment on the magnitude of residues parent chlorothalonil and the possible formation of the degradation products identified in standard hydrolysis studies (i.e. R182281 and R613636) are not available.The dietary burden calculation was updated in the current assessment. The only remaining use relevant for feed is the use in peanuts. Overall, the expected intake of chlorothalonil by livestock was below the trigger value for all animal species. Hence, the existing MRLs for animal products are no longer required and risk managers may consider lowering them to the LOQ.Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concluded that the long‐term intake of residues resulting from the use of chlorothalonil according to the reported agricultural practices is unlikely to present a risk to consumer health for parent chlorothalonil. For papaya, an acute intake concern was identified (433% of the acute reference dose (ARfD)). For banana and peanuts, no acute consumer risk for chlorothalonil was derived.Since toxicological reference values for SDS‐3701 are not available, the consumer risk assessment for this metabolite could not be finalised.The summary table below provides an overview of the assessment of confirmatory data and the recommended MRL modifications to Regulation (EU) No 396/2005.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodea\n\nCommodity\nExisting MRL Chlorothalonilb\n\nProposed MRL Chlorothalonil\nProposed MRL SDS‐3701\nConclusion/recommendation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExisting enforcement residue definition for plants and animals: Chlorothalonil\n\n\nAdditional\n\nresidue definitions for enforcement for plants: R182281 (SDS‐3701) (proposed in the MRL review, not yet implemented)\n\n\n\n0130000\nPome fruit\n2 (ft1)\n0.01*\n0.01*\n\nThe existing MRL reflects the previously authorised SEU GAP.

European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified some information as unavailable (data gaps) and derived tentative MRLs for those uses not fully supported by data but for which no risk to consumers was identified. The following data gaps were identified by EFSA:\nData gaps for the finalisation of the risk assessment of SDS‐3701:\n\n\nA validated method for enforcement of metabolite SDS‐3701 in plant commodities, including processed fractions;\n\nA complete set of residue trials compliant with available guidance documents and allowing for the estimation of SDS‐3701 levels in all crops supported in the framework of this review;\n\nStorage stability studies demonstrating the stability of SDS‐3701 in plant commodities, including processed fractions;\n\nFurther information on the magnitude of SDS‐3701 in processed commodities that have been subject to high temperatures;\n\nA study investigating metabolism of chlorothalonil and metabolite SDS‐3701 in pigs;\n\nFurther characterisation of the TRR in poultry commodities (if the dietary burden increases in the future).\n\n\nData gaps for the parent chlorothalonil:\n\n\nAn analytical method, its ILV and a confirmatory method fully validated for the determination of parent chlorothalonil in hops;\n\nA storage stability study for parent chlorothalonil in high acid content commodities;\n\nEight residue trials on apples and pears (with a minimum of 4 trials on apples) complying with the southern outdoor good agricultural practices (GAPs) for apples, quinces, medlars and loquats;\n\nFour residue trials on apricots and four residue trials on peaches complying with the southern outdoor GAP;\n\nFour residue trials on turnips complying with the southern outdoor GAP;\n\nEight residue trials on head cabbage complying with the northern outdoor GAP;\n\nEight residue trials on leek complying with the northern outdoor GAP;\n\nFour additional trials on fresh peas (without pods) complying with the southern outdoor GAP;\n\nFour residue trials on hops complying with the northern outdoor GAP.\n\nFollowing the MRL review, the MRL modifications proposed for chlorothalonil have been implemented in the MRL legislation by Commission Regulation (EU) No 1146/20142, including footnotes implementing the data gaps identified by EFSA in points 1–15 (above) as confirmatory data requirements. Lacking data for SDS‐3701, MRLs for the second residue definition could not be established.Any parties having an interest in maintaining the tentative MRLs were requested to address the confirmatory data requirement by 29 October 2016.In accordance with the specific provisions, the applicants Syngenta Crop Protection, UPL Europe Ltd. (Arysta LifeScience SAS) and Oxon Italia S.p.A (members of Chlorothalonil Task Force) submitted applications to the competent national authority in the Netherlands (designated rapporteur Member State, RMS) to evaluate the confirmatory data identified during the MRL review. In support of the applications, the applicants provided residue trials and referred to data that were assessed in the framework of the renewal of the approval of chlorothalonil (EFSA, 2018a). In addition, applications for modifications of some of the existing MRLs were submitted reflecting intended modifications of the EU use patterns.The applicant Syngenta Crop Protection provided the following information:\n\nInformation to support import tolerances for chlorothalonil in peanuts, bananas and papaya (for papaya and peanuts, the GAPs assessed in the framework of the MRL review were no longer supported. Instead, alternative GAPs were reported);\nData to justify the modification of the existing MRLs for chlorothalonil on peaches (incl. nectarines), apricots, grapes, carrot, parsley, salsify, parsnips, horseradish, radish, spring onions/welsh onions, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, head cabbage, beans without pods, peas without pods and leek;\nData to support the setting MRLs for SDS‐3701 (R182281) in spring onions/welsh onions, cucurbits‐edible peel, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, head cabbage, fresh legumes (beans and peas with pods, beans and peas without pods), asparagus, pulses (beans without pods, chickpeas), barley, oats, wheat, rye, triticale.\nOXON Italia S.p.A. submitted information to address the confirmatory data requirements for metabolite SDS‐3701: residue trials were submitted for melon, cucumber/courgette, peas and sugar beet for GAPs which were less critical compared to the authorised EU GAPs assessed during the Article 12 review (EFSA, 2012).UPL Europe Ltd. (formerly Arysta LifeScience SAS) submitted residue data on wheat, barley, tomatoes and dry peas (pulses) to address the confirmatory data requirements for the metabolite SDS‐3701; the data on wheat, barley and tomatoes were already assessed during the renewal process (EFSA, 2018a).The RMS assessed the relevant information in an evaluation report, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA on April 2018 (Netherlands, 2018).EFSA proceeded with the assessment of the application and confirmatory data as requested by the European Commission in accordance with Article 9 of the Regulation. During the detailed assessment, EFSA identified points which needed further clarifications. In response to the clock‐stop letter, on 16 January 2020, the RMS submitted a revised evaluation report which addressed the points for clarification.In the framework of the process on the renewal of the approval of chlorothalonil, a number of data gaps relevant for the consumer risk assessment were identified (data to elucidate the toxicological profile of the metabolite SDS‐3701 (R182281), R613636 and R417888 were missing, and consequently, definitive residue definitions for risk assessment in plant and animal commodities could not be derived) (EFSA, 2018a).On 29 April 2019, a decision on the non‐renewal of the approval of chlorothalonil under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 was taken.3 Following the decision on the non‐renewal of the approval, the EU uses of plant protection products containing chlorothalonil had to be withdrawn by 20 November 2019 (period of grace according to Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009: 20 May 2020). Considering the new situation for EU authorisations, the data gaps related to the EU uses (i.e. data gaps 7 and 9 to 15 and partially data gaps 2 and 4 to 6) became obsolete.EFSA therefore focused in this assessment on the import tolerance for banana, papaya and peanuts and the generic data gap on analytical method, storage stability and the data gap on the magnitude of SDS‐3701 in processed commodities that have been subject to high temperatures, which are also relevant for the import tolerance requests. For certain crops for which confirmatory data were requested, Codex MRLs are in place. EFSA also provided information to risk managers on the existing Codex MRLs. It should be highlighted that the purpose of the current assessment was not the assessment of data gaps identified in the renewal process that lead to the non‐renewal of the approval. However, to provide a comprehensive view and allow risk managers to take an informed decision, EFSA noted the relevance of the data gaps for the uses assessed, where relevant.EFSA based its assessment on the evaluation report and additional information provided in response to the clock‐stop letter submitted by the RMS (Netherlands, 2018), the reasoned opinion on the MRL review according to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 and additional assessments of chlorothalonil performed after the MRL review (EFSA, 2015, 2018a).The evaluation of confirmatory data was performed in accordance with the procedure set out in the Commission Staff Working Document SANTE/10235/2016 (European Commission, 2020). For this application, the data requirements established in Regulation (EU) No 544/20114 and the relevant guidance documents at the date of implementation of the confirmatory data requirements by Regulation (EU) No 1146/2014 are applicable.An updated list of end points, including the end points of relevant studies assessed previously and the confirmatory data evaluated in this application, is presented in Appendix B.The evaluation report submitted by the RMS (Netherlands, 2018) is considered as a supporting document to this reasoned opinion and, thus, is made publicly available as a background document to this reasoned opinion.In the framework of the MRL review, the dietary burden was calculated for dairy ruminants, meat ruminants, poultry and pigs taking into account the notified EU uses and uses in third countries for which import tolerances were requested. The dietary burden calculation was the basis for deriving MRL proposals for food of animal origin in the MRL review (EFSA, 2012).Considering that the EU authorisations for most of the crops used in the dietary burden calculation have been withdrawn due to the decision of non‐approval of chlorothalonil, the dietary burden calculation was updated in the current assessment. The only remaining use relevant for the dietary burden calculation is the use in peanuts.The animal exposure calculation for peanut meal was performed according to the new methodology currently in use (OECD, 2013). Since residues of chlorothalonil and SDS‐3701 were both below the LOQ, respectively, the default processing factor for peanut meal of 2 was not used in the calculation of the animal dietary burden. The results of the dietary burden calculation for chlorothalonil and SDS‐3701 are presented in Appendix B.2. The calculated dietary burden was below the trigger value for all animal species. Hence, EFSA concluded that the existing MRLs for animal products could be lowered to the LOQ. Data gap number (5)21 and (6)22 of the MRL review are not relevant, as long as no other feed items treated with chlorothalonil enter the EU feed chain.The applicants Syngenta Crop Protection, Oxon Italia S.p.A. and UPL Europe Ltd. (formerly Arysta LifeScience SAS) submitted data to address the data gaps identified in the framework of the MRL review (EFSA, 2012). Considering the decision on the non‐approval of chlorothalonil, confirmatory data for EU uses became obsolete. EFSA therefore focused in this assessment on the import tolerance for banana, papaya and peanuts and the generic data gap on analytical method, storage stability and the data gap on the magnitude of SDS‐3701 in processed commodities that have been subject to high temperatures, which are also relevant for the import tolerance requests.The submitted residue trials were sufficient to derive MRL proposals for banana, papaya and peanuts for chlorothalonil and SDS‐3701. For banana, a valid label for the registration of chlorothalonil in Latin American countries, which describes the use conditions for chlorothalonil in detail, was not provided.Storage stability data were provided and were considered sufficient to address the data gap identified in the MRL review.Adequate analytical methods for enforcement are available to control the residues of chlorothalonil and SDS‐3701 in plant matrices at the validated LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg. However, data to demonstrate that the method is capable to quantify reliably residues of SDS‐3701 in high oil commodities (data on the extraction efficiency of the method) are not available and the previously identified data gap is not addressed.For papaya, the lack of high temperature processing studies was noted; hence, the formation of relevant concentrations of the degradation products SDS‐3701 and R613636 for which the toxicological profile is not fully elucidated cannot be excluded.The long‐term exposure to chlorothalonil residues in the crops for which uses in third countries were reported/assessed did not exceed the ADI. For banana and peanuts, the expected short‐term exposure did not exceed the ARfD; for papaya, a short‐term consumer health risk could not be excluded for chlorothalonil residues. As regards SDS‐3701, the consumer risk assessment could not be finalised, lacking data on the toxicological profile of this metabolite/degradation product.The overview of the assessment of confirmatory data and the recommended MRL modifications are summarised in Appendix B.4.\n\n\n\n\na.s.\n\nactive substance\n\n\n\n\nADI\n\nacceptable daily intake\n\n\n\n\nAR\n\napplied radioactivity\n\n\n\n\nARfD\n\nacute reference dose\n\n\n\n\nBBCH\n\ngrowth stages of mono‐ and dicotyledonous plants\n\n\n\n\nBw\n\nbody weight\n\n\n\n\nCAC\n\nCodex Alimentarius Commission\n\n\n\n\nCAS\n\nChemical Abstract Service\n\n\n\n\nCCPR\n\nCodex Committee on Pesticide Residues\n\n\n\n\nCEN\n\nEuropean Committee for Standardisation (Comité Européen de Normalisation)\n\n\n\n\nCF\n\nconversion factor for enforcement to risk assessment residue definition\n\n\n\n\nCIRCA\n\n(EU) Communication & Information Resource Centre Administrator\n\n\n\n\nCS\n\ncapsule suspension\n\n\n\n\nCV\n\ncoefficient of variation (relative standard deviation)\n\n\n\n\nCXL\n\nCodex maximum residue limit\n\n\n\n\nDAR\n\ndraft assessment report\n\n\n\n\nDAT\n\ndays after treatment\n\n\n\n\nDM\n\ndry matter\n\n\n\n\nDP\n\ndustable powder\n\n\n\n\nDS\n\npowder for dry seed treatment\n\n\n\n\nDT90\n\nperiod required for 90% dissipation (define method of estimation)\n\n\n\n\nEC\n\nemulsifiable concentrate\n\n\n\n\nEDI\n\nestimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nEMS\n\nevaluating Member State\n\n\n\n\nFID\n\nflame ionisation detector\n\n\n\n\nFLD\n\nfluorescence detector\n\n\n\n\nFPD\n\nflame photometric detector\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nGC‐MS\n\ngas chromatography with mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nGS\n\ngrowth stage\n\n\n\n\nHR\n\nhighest residue\n\n\n\n\nIEDI\n\ninternational estimated daily intake\n\n\n\n\nIESTI\n\ninternational estimated short‐term intake\n\n\n\n\nILV\n\nindependent laboratory validation\n\n\n\n\nIPCS\n\nInternational Programme of Chemical Safety\n\n\n\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organisation for Standardisation\n\n\n\n\nIUPAC\n\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n\n\n\n\nJMPR\n\nJoint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues\n\n\n\n\nLC\n\nliquid chromatography\n\n\n\n\nLOQ\n\nlimit of quantification\n\n\n\n\nMRL\n\nmaximum residue level\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nMember States\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\nmass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nMS/MS\n\ntandem mass spectrometry detector\n\n\n\n\nMW\n\nmolecular weight\n\n\n\n\nNEU\n\nnorthern Europe\n\n\n\n\nOECD\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development\n\n\n\n\nPF\n\nprocessing factor\n\n\n\n\nPHI\n\npreharvest interval\n\n\n\n\nPRIMo\n\n(EFSA) Pesticide Residues Intake Model\n\n\n\n\nRA\n\nrisk assessment\n\n\n\n\nRAC\n\nraw agricultural commodity\n\n\n\n\nRD\n\nresidue definition\n\n\n\n\nRMS\n\nrapporteur Member State\n\n\n\n\nRPF\n\nrelative potency factor\n\n\n\n\nSANCO\n\nDirectorate‐General for Health and Consumers\n\n\n\n\nSC\n\nsuspension concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSL\n\nsoluble concentrate\n\n\n\n\nSP\n\nwater‐soluble powder\n\n\n\n\nSTMR\n\nsupervised trials median residue\n\n\n\n\nTAR\n\ntotal applied radioactivity\n\n\n\n\nTMDI\n\ntheoretical maximum daily intake\n\n\n\n\nTRR\n\ntotal radioactive residue\n\n\n\n\nUV\n\nultraviolet (detector)\n\n\n\n\nWG\n\nwater‐dispersible granule\n\n\n\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n\n\nWP\n\nwettable powder\n\n\n"

        "summary": "The conclusions of the   following the peer review of the initial risk assessment carried out by the competent authority of the rapporteur Member State, the United Kingdom, for the pesticide active substance tri‐allate are reported. The context of the peer review was that requested by the European Commission following the submission and evaluation of confirmatory data. The conclusions were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of tri‐allate as a herbicide on cereals (barley and wheat). The reliable endpoints concluded as being appropriate for use in regulatory risk assessment, derived from the available studies and literature in the dossier peer reviewed, are presented. Concerns are identified.",
        "full-text": "Tri‐allate was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 January 2010 by Commission Directive 2009/77/EC and has been deemed to be approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 541/2011. It was a specific provision of the approval that the applicant was required to submit to the European Commission further information to assess the primary plant metabolism, further information on the fate and behaviour of the soil metabolite diisopropylamine (DIPA), further information on the potential for biomagnification in aquatic food chains, information to further address the risk to fish‐eating mammals and the long‐term risk to earthworms by 31 December 2011.In accordance with the specific provision, the applicant, Gowan Comércio Internacional e Servicos submitted an updated dossier in December 2011 which was evaluated by the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS), the United Kingdom, in the form of an addendum to the draft assessment report. In compliance with the guidance document SANCO 5634/2009‐rev. 6.1, the RMS distributed the addendum to the Member States, the applicant and EFSA for comments on 23 September 2015. The RMS collated all comments in the format of a reporting table, which was submitted to EFSA in December 2015.Following consideration of the comments received, the European Commission requested EFSA to organise a peer review of the evaluation by the RMS of the confirmatory data submitted in relation to residues and fate and behaviour and to deliver its conclusions on the following points:\n\nthe plant residue definitions, including the relevance of the metabolites peak 14, conjugates M14 and M15, DIPA and TCPSA;\nthe relevance of livestock exposure and the need for livestock metabolism studies as well as the relevance of rotational crop residues and the need for rotational crop studies;\nthe consumer risk assessment;\nto examine how the calculation of the formation fractions can be calculated if a substantial part of tri‐allate is volatilised as well as the impact of any changes on predicted environmental concentration (PEC) values of tri‐allate and its metabolites should be reported.\nThe toxicological profile, including genotoxic potential of tri‐allate metabolites TCPSA, M14, M15 and DIPA were clarified according to the guidelines applicable at the time of the first peer review and dietary toxicological reference values were established for these metabolites. It was noted that according to current scientific knowledge, aneugenicity has not been sufficiently addressed. Nevertheless, the experts considered that according to the guidelines applicable at the time of the first peer review, the genotoxicity potential had been sufficiently assessed. No information has been provided on the metabolite referred to as ‘peak 14’. In addition, but out of the scope of this confirmatory data mandate, it was noted that a concern regarding the mutagenicity potential of the parent compound could not be excluded based on the observation of positive Ames tests not adequately followed up in vivo according to current scientific knowledge. The experts agreed that this concern should be flagged in the present conclusion.On the basis of new wheat metabolism data, the residue definition for risk assessment derived by the first peer review was amended to include a new relevant metabolite, DIPA, that has lower toxicological reference values than tri‐allate. Data on the magnitude of DIPA residues in primary and rotational crops and animal matrices are not available. Moreover, the applicant's hypothesis on unidentified ‘peak 14’ as a structurally and toxicologically similar metabolite requires substantiation. As occurrence of significant residues of DIPA might be expected in different commodities, the investigation of effects of food processing is recommended in view of the potential of DIPA for formation of nitrosamines. Currently, a robust consumer dietary risk assessment with regard to DIPA cannot be conducted. As for metabolite TCPSA, the lack of residue trials in primary and rotational crops with determination of TCPSA conjugated residues leads to uncertainty in the risk assessment for this metabolite. Altogether the consumer risk assessment for the representative uses of tri‐allate cannot be concluded.With respect to the fate and behaviour in the environment, the groundwater metabolite TCPSA, exceeded 0.75 μg/L for all relevant scenarios and 10 μg/L in four scenarios. The groundwater metabolite DIPA exceeded 10 μg/L for all scenarios. DIPA is a known precursor of N‐nitroso‐diisopropanolamine. The issue of possible formation of N‐nitroso‐diisopropylamine from DIPA and under which conditions it may be produced (e.g. effect of water treatment procedures) remains also open at this stage.Tri‐allate was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 January 2010 by Commission Directive 2009/77/EC1, and has been deemed to be approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/20092, in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/20113, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 541/20114. EFSA previously finalised a Conclusion on this active substance on 26 September 2008 in the EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 181 (EFSA, 2009).It was a specific provision of the approval that the applicant was required to submit to the European Commission further information to assess the primary plant metabolism, further information on the fate and behaviour of the soil metabolite diisopropylamine (DIPA), further information on the potential for biomagnification in aquatic food chains, information to further address the risk to fish‐eating mammals and the long‐term risk to earthworms by 31 December 2011.In accordance with the specific provision, the applicant, Gowan Comércio Internacional e Servicos submitted an updated dossier in December 2011, which was evaluated by the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS), the United Kingdom, in the form of an addendum to the draft assessment report (United Kingdom, 2015). In compliance with the guidance document SANCO 5634/2009‐rev. 6.1 (European Commission, 2013), the RMS distributed the addendum to Member States, the applicant and EFSA for comments on 23 September 2015. The RMS collated all comments in the format of a reporting table, which was submitted to EFSA in December 2015, leading to the conclusions published in the EFSA Technical Report (EFSA, 2016).Following consideration of the comments received, in September 2018, the European Commission requested EFSA to organise a peer review of the evaluation of the RMS of the confirmatory data submitted in relation to residues and fate and behaviour and to deliver its conclusions on the following points:\n\nthe plant residue definitions, including the relevance of metabolites peak 14, conjugates M14 and M15, DIPA and TCPSA;\nthe relevance of livestock exposure and the need for livestock metabolism studies as well as the relevance of rotational crop residues and the need for rotational crop studies;\nthe consumer risk assessment;\nto examine how the calculation of the formation fractions can be calculated if a substantial part of tri‐allate is volatilised as well as the impact of any changes on predicted environmental concentration (PEC) values of tri‐allate and its metabolites should be reported.\nThe addendum and the reporting table were discussed at the Pesticides Peer Review Experts’ Meetings on environmental fate and behaviour, mammalian toxicology and residues in November 2018, January and February 2019. Details of the issues discussed, together with the outcome of these discussions were recorded in the meeting reports.A final consultation on the conclusions arising from the peer review took place with Member States via a written procedure in April 2019.The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the peer review of the RMS's evaluation of the confirmatory data submitted in relation to mammalian toxicology, residues and environmental fate and behaviour. A key supporting document to this conclusion is the peer review report, which is a compilation of the documentation developed to evaluate and address all issues raised in the peer review, from the compilation of comments in the reporting table to the conclusion. The peer review report (EFSA, 2020) comprises the following documents, in which all views expressed during the course of the peer review, including minority views, can be found:\n\nthe reporting table (12 January 2016)5;\nthe reports of the scientific consultation with Member State experts;\nthe comments received on the draft EFSA conclusion.\nGiven the importance of the DAR including its final addendum (United Kingdom, 2019) and the peer review report, these documents are considered as background documents to this conclusion.It is recommended that this conclusion report and its background documents would not be accepted to support any registration outside the EU for which the applicant has not demonstrated to have regulatory access to the information on which this conclusion report is based.Tri‐allate is the ISO common name for S‐2,3,3‐trichloroallyl diisopropyl(thiocarbamate) (IUPAC). The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ‘Avadex 15G’ (‘Mon 7966’), a granule (GR) containing 150 g/kg tri‐allate. The representative uses evaluated comprised post‐sowing and pre‐emergence applications with tractor mounted ground applicator to control wild oats, black‐grass and meadow‐grass in summer and winter barley and wheat.The applicant has submitted to the Commission by the deadline of 31 December 2011 studies to provide further information to assess the primary plant metabolism, further information on the fate and behaviour of the soil metabolite diisopropylamine (DIPA), further information on the potential for biomagnification in aquatic food chains, information to further address the risk to fish‐eating mammals and the long‐term risk to earthworms. The assessment of the information was presented in revised confirmatory data addenda (United Kingdom, 2015), updated in January 2019 (United Kingdom, 2019).In the mammalian toxicology area, additional information has been provided on tri‐allate metabolites TCPSA and DIPA; their toxicological profile was discussed during the Pesticides Peer Review Experts’ meeting 190, session 2, in January 2019.Following the request for confirmatory data, no further information was provided for the metabolite ‘peak 14’ (identity and/or toxicity) and further clarification regarding the significance of this compound as a residue in plant was requested (see Section 2).The genotoxicity potential of TCPSA was already assessed in the previous conclusion (EFSA, 2009) and no concerns had been identified; accordingly the metabolite was found not relevant according to the guidance document on the assessment of the relevance of metabolites in groundwater (European Commission, 2003) up to stage 3 of step 3. It was noted that according to current scientific knowledge, the aneugenicity might not be sufficiently addressed in the chromosome aberration test and should be further assessed in the framework of the renewal process. Nevertheless, the experts considered that according to the guidelines applicable at the time of the first peer review, the genotoxicity potential had been sufficiently assessed. TCPSA presents low acute toxicity after ingestion; based on 14‐day and 28‐day toxicity studies in rats, it was concluded that the metabolite is of equivalent toxicity or most likely lower toxicity when compared to the parent tri‐allate. Therefore, the dietary reference values of tri‐allate are applicable to TCPSA. The metabolites M14 and M15 are not rat metabolites and are glycosides of TCPSA; hydrolysis of these metabolites is likely to occur in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in the generation of their aglycon M1 (a major metabolite identified in rat metabolism) and TCPSA, respectively. It was considered that their toxicological profile is addressed by the studies performed with tri‐allate and TCPSA, allowing to conclude that the dietary reference values of the parent are applicable also to these two metabolites.Regarding the metabolite DIPA, it appears to be acutely more toxic than the parent and presents a different toxicological profile than tri‐allate such as local irritation/corrosivity and secondary systemic effects (changes in clinical chemistry). Based on newly submitted genotoxicity studies, it was concluded that DIPA is unlikely to be genotoxic in vitro. It was noted that according to current scientific knowledge, the aneugenicity might not be sufficiently addressed in the chromosome aberration test and should be further assessed in the framework of the renewal process. Nevertheless, the experts considered that according to the guidelines applicable at the time of the first peer review, the genotoxicity potential had been sufficiently assessed. An acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0.015 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day was established for the metabolite, based on the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 15 mg/kg bw per day from the 28‐day study in rat, and applying an uncertainty factor (UF) of 1,000, that includes an additional UF of 10 to account for the lack of chronic, carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity data. An acute reference dose (ARfD) of 0.15 mg/kg bw was established, based on the local and systemic NOAEL of 15 mg/kg bw per day from the 28‐day study and applying the standard UF of 100. An additional UF to account for the lacking developmental toxicity study is not needed in this case, considering the corrosive effects of the compound.It is noted that the genotoxicity assessment conducted in 2008 on the parent compound tri‐allate fails to demonstrate a lack of genotoxicity potential according to the current scientific developments (EFSA Scientific Committee, 2011). Three positive Ames tests were followed up with a negative in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) test. It is currently well recognised that the latter test is not sufficiently sensitive to overrule the positive results observed in vitro. In addition, some carbamate‐derived chemical structures have been identified in the open literature as potential genotoxic compounds in vitro. Even though this was not part of the confirmatory data process and therefore not revised by the applicant and/or the RMS, the experts agreed that this concern should be flagged in the present conclusion for further considerations during the renewal process.In addition to the previously assessed metabolism studies in wheat and peas (EFSA, 2009), new metabolism data in wheat upon soil treatment with diisopropylamine (DIPA) and allyl labelled tri‐allate were submitted. On the basis of the recent studies and the information provided by the section on mammalian toxicology regarding metabolites TCPSA and DIPA, the residue definition for risk assessment has been set in the confirmatory data process as:\n\nSum of tri‐allate, TCPSA and TCPSA conjugates, expressed as tri‐allate, and 2) DIPA\nApplication of the derived residue definition for risk assessment purposes should be restricted to soil applied uses in cereals since metabolism data with foliar application are not available. As the new wheat metabolism data revealed the presence of a relevant metabolite DIPA (45–60% total radioactive residue (TRR) and with lower reference values applicable than tri‐allate, see Section 1 above), the provisional residue definition derived by the peer review (EFSA, 2009) was amended to include this metabolite in addition (part 2) above) to the initial proposal (part 1) above).An unidentified metabolite ‘peak 14’ was present at levels in wheat grains which ideally should have been identified, specifically as DIPA has lower toxicological reference values than tri‐allate and has the potential to form N‐nitroso‐diisopropylamine. The applicant's hypothesis on ‘peak 14’ as a derivative of DIPA with a toxicological profile comparable to DIPA should be further substantiated and the presence of DIPA‐derived nitrosamines should be ruled out (data gap).It is recommended to currently maintain the residue definition for monitoring as tri‐allate and to review this definition once residue trials analysing for the complete residue definition have been submitted and permit an evaluation whether tri‐allate is a sufficiently good marker (< LOQ in grain).The currently available field trials in cereals did not determine residues of TCPSA conjugates and DIPA but only of tri‐allate and TCPSA (free). However, based on the findings in the wheat metabolism study, a significant increase of TCPSA total residues, i.e. including TCPSA conjugates, and quantifiable residue levels of DIPA may be expected. Therefore, the available residue trials are insufficient to conduct robust exposure and risk assessments and residue trials with analysis of DIPA and TCPSA, including its conjugates, are requested (data gap).The soil‐applied primary crop metabolism and soil degradation studies conducted with diisopropylamine labelled tri‐allate complement the rotational crop metabolism study that limited the investigations to the allyl portion of the molecule. A similar metabolite picture is expected in soil‐applied primary and rotational crops. This assumption should be confirmed by the previously requested (EFSA, 2009) rotational crop field trials in representative crop categories, analysing commodities for tri‐allate, TCPSA (free and conjugated) and DIPA, and with particular attention to the detection of nitrosamines as DIPA is a known precursor of N‐nitroso‐diisopropylamine.For the same reason of potential formation of nitrosamines, investigation of the behaviour of DIPA under conditions representative for food processing should be investigated, if significant residues will be found in residue trials with investigation of DIPA.As residue trials with determination of the relevant residue compounds for risk assessment are not available, robust assessments of the livestock dietary burden and the potential transfer of residues into animal commodities cannot be conducted. Should the calculated animal intakes exceed the established trigger value, which is indicated by tentative estimates using metabolism data, additional livestock metabolism studies (investigating the behaviour of diisopropylamine‐labelled tri‐allate) might be necessary. Currently, residue definitions in animal commodities cannot be derived.A robust consumer risk assessment according to the derived residue definition cannot be conducted without residue trials determining the actual concentrations of all relevant analytes. The RMS attempted a provisional assessment for part 1) of the residue definition, using residue data for tri‐allate and free TCPSA, where available, and adding assumptions and factors to compensate for missing data in crops and animal commodities, i.e. adding several non‐standard uncertainties. With this approach, the maximum estimated intakes for the sum of tri‐allate, TCPSA and TCPSA conjugates, expressed as tri‐allate with PRIMO rev. 2 correspond to approx. 27% of the ADI and 6% of the ARfD. As TCPSA is also a metabolite leaching to groundwater (see Section 3 on environmental fate and behaviour), a relevance assessment was triggered and the consumer exposure with regard to residues of metabolite TCPSA in groundwater abstracted for drinking water purposes was assessed on the basis of the predicted concentrations in groundwater. The estimates are based on WHO default assumptions (WHO, 2004). The intake of TCPSA residues via drinking water corresponds to 5%, 16% and 24% of the ADI applicable to TCPSA for adults, toddlers and infants, respectively.A separate risk assessment attempt for part 2) of the residue definition for dietary risk assessment, DIPA, was based on a single residue value derived for cereal grain from the metabolism study as residue trials in cereals for DIPA are not available. Moreover, residues in rotational crops to which significant uptake of DIPA from soil is expected and potential transfer into animal commodities via feed items could not be considered without any data available. A reliable consumer risk assessment cannot be conducted for DIPA.DIPA is also a metabolite in groundwater that triggered a relevance assessment. The consumer exposure via groundwater is predicted to be approximately 18% of the ADI of DIPA for adults, 55% for toddlers and 83% for infants. It is not known to which extent dietary intake of DIPA residues from food of plant and possibly animal origin will contribute in addition, however, significant residues in primary and rotational crops might be expected from the currently available data. When a combined exposure assessment is performed for DIPA considering exposure via food and groundwater, it cannot be excluded that exposures could exceed an acceptable level depending on the consumer group.With respect to the fate and behaviour in the environment, the peer review of the confirmatory data assessment confirmed the formation fractions used by the RMS for the fate and behaviour modelling. The groundwater exposure assessment presented by the RMS was therefore agreed in the experts’ meeting:For TCPSA, the 80th percentile annual average concentration exceeded 0.75 μg/L for all scenarios and 10 μg/L for the Hamburg, Jokioinen, Kremsmünster and Okehampton scenarios using the PEARL 3.3.3 model. The relevance of TCPSA was assessed following the step‐wise procedure set out in the guidance document for relevance of metabolites in groundwater (see Sections 1 and 2 for toxicology and consumers risk assessment).For DIPA, the 80th percentile annual average concentration exceeded 10 μg/L for all scenarios using the PEARL 3.3.3 model. An assessment of the relevance of the tri‐allate metabolite DIPA in groundwater has been performed, but not finalised, including an exposure assessment (see Sections 1 and 2 for toxicology and consumers risk assessment and Section 5.1 for issues that could not be finalised). DIPA is a known precursor of N‐nitroso‐diisopropylamine. The issue of possible formation of N‐nitroso‐diisopropylamine from DIPA and under which conditions it may be produced (e.g. effect of water treatment procedures) remain also open at this stage.Data gaps identified during this focussed peer review of confirmatory data assessment are listed below.

        "summary": "In the last decades, there is an increasing inclusion of various trace metals and metalloids such as thallium, tellurium and rare earth elements ( s; lanthanides, scandium, and yttrium) in the composition and production of alloys, in agricultural and medicinal applications, as well as in the manufacturing of hi‐tech products. All these activities have led to an accumulation of the aforementioned elements both in soil and water bodies and consequently in the food chain, through discharges from mining and mineral processing, liquid industrial waste or disposal of urban and industrial products. It has been demonstrated that chronic exposure to some of these elements, even at low doses, might lead to a wide range of adverse health effects, even from the early stages of life, such as neurotoxicity, neurodevelopmental toxicity and hepatic alterations. Particularly in children, there have been studies suggesting that some of these elements might negatively affect the children's spatial learning and memory ability indirectly. Such effects are triggered by processes like the production of reactive oxygen species ( ), lipid peroxidation and modulation of antioxidant activities. Nevertheless, the limited data from toxicological studies and their so‐far naturally low occurrence levels in the environment acted as a deterrent in measuring their concentrations during routine analyses of metals in foodstuff. Thus, it is important to collect information on their occurrence data both in adults and in children's daily diet. This review sumrises the current knowledge on the concentration of these elements, in plant‐based food products to identify whether a potential health risk occurs. As side projects, this Fellowship provided hands‐on training on the evaluation of new biocides application and participation in the given advice to the Danish Food and Veterinary Administration, Danish Environmental Protection Agency, the Danish Medical Agency and the European Chemicals Agency.",
        "full-text": "The history of human kind has been closely connected with metals and metalloids. Most attention has so far been paid to heavy metals and their toxicity to humans, through the food consumption. Nevertheless, in the last decades, the use of various trace metals and metalloids has increased in medicinal, industrial and agricultural applications (Du and Graedel, 2011). As a result, there has been an elevation in their accumulation in the ecosystem (atmosphere, water, soil), resulting in potential human contamination via food, through discharges from mining and mineral processing, liquid industrial waste or disposal of urban and industrial products (Cheng et al., 2015).In the current review, we focus on the rare earth elements, thallium, and tellurium. It has been documented that they can pass through the gastrointestinal tract and accumulate in the human body causing short‐ or long‐term structural or functional alterations that can eventually lead to a toxic effect.The widespread application of the aforementioned elements in numerous industries and agriculture is increasing, by possibly leading to an increase of their concentrations into the environment and consequently our food. Therefore, the fact that these potentially toxic elements have been already detected in several plant‐based foodstuff is of concern (Appendix A).For some of these elements, we have acquired knowledge regarding their adverse effects in human health. However, most of the animal studies up to now are limited to few REE (mostly Ce and La), and short‐/medium‐term tests (Pagano et al., 2015a; Pagano et al., 2015b).The little research regarding their potential on humans toxicity combined with their high request in the technological applications has led to an apparent need to extend the research on this field, including hazard evaluation and risk assessment. The same argument applies for Tl and Te, as studies of long‐term exposures and life‐long observations are yet lacking, while their occurrence in human's diet is evident.The present study constitutes just the first step of all the steps needed to establish a chemical risk assessment regarding the potential risks posed by REEs, Tl and Te present in plant‐based foodstuff, including baby‐food. Nevertheless, this is a key step to estimate the size of this risk, according to the current knowledge. The next step would be to evaluate their content in foods that are consumed by the general population and to estimate their actual dietary intake.From a broader perspective, the EU‐FORA programme provided the means to a fast and extensive first‐hand knowledge and experience of food risk assessment. During the modules and hands‐on training, the EU‐FORA fellowship programme offered a unique opportunity of networking and enhancing the cooperation among the food safety agencies. In a multicultural atmosphere, the colleagues of the National Food Institute, DTU provided the expertise and mentoring, and creating the ideal environment for knowledge exchange on food safety. Therefore, National Food Institute makes a suitable host site for future EU‐FORA fellows.\n\n\n\n\nAGES\n\nAustrian Agency for Health and Food Safety\n\n\n\n\nBfR\n\nGerman Federal Institute for Risk Assessment\n\n\n\n\nCAT\n\ncatalase\n\n\n\n\nDTU\n\nTechnical University of Denmark\n\n\n\n\nDW\n\ndry weight\n\n\n\n\nECHA\n\nEuropean Chemicals Agency\n\n\n\n\nEFET\n\nHellenic Food Authority\n\n\n\n\nEPA\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency\n\n\n\n\nEU‐FORA\n\nEuropean Union Food Risk Assessment\n\n\n\n\nfw\n\nfresh weight\n\n\n\n\nGPx\n\nglutathione peroxidase\n\n\n\n\nREEs\n\nrare earth elements\n\n\n\n\nROS\n\nreactive oxygen species\n\n\n\n\nSOD\n\nsuperoxide dismutase\n\n\n"

        "summary": "Phthalates are a group of diesters of phthalic acid and have been widely used by the industry as plasticisers giving flexibility and durability to polyvinyl chloride ( ) plastics. Commonly their uses vary from plasticisers in food contact materials and toys to emulsifying agents in personal care products. Phthalates are not covalently bound to  , thus they can migrate into the air, skin, water, food and the environment. The omnipresence of phthalates results in human exposure via multiple pathways such as dermal, oral and inhalation for prolonged periods. There is evidence that phthalates can induce disruption in oestrogenic activity, reproductive, developmental and liver toxicity both in experimental animals and potentially in humans. The aim of this technical report is to summarise the activities of the fellow performed at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health ( ). The goals of the work programme were collecting concentration levels on five specific phthalates from the scientific literature and combining them with consumption/use data reported in a biomonitoring study part of a Horizon 2020 project (EuroMix), and finally, estimate the aggregate phthalate exposure from food and personal care products and compare them with the measured phthalate levels in urine samples collected in the biomonitoring study.",
        "full-text": "Phthalates are diesters of phthalic acid and have been widely used in the industry as plasticisers giving flexibility and durability to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics. Commonly their uses range from plasticisers in plastics, including food contact materials and toys, as emulsifying agents and solvents in personal care products (PCPs), to excipients used in the pharmaceutical industry. This widespread use leads to a ubiquitous, constant and virtually unavoidable exposure in humans. Phthalates can migrate into the air, water and foodstuff, and humans can be exposed via multiple pathways such as dermal, oral and inhalation.The phthalate plasticiser global market currently stands at approximate 5.5 million metric tonnes per year (OECD, 2018). The biggest market being the People's Republic of China accounting for 45% of all use, followed by Europe and the USA with a combined 25% use. There is evidence in the literature that phthalates can induce disruption in oestrogenic activity, reproductive, developmental and liver toxicity both in experimental animals and in humans (Gray et al., 2000; Heudorf et al., 2007; Lyche et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2014). Di‐2‐ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), one of the most widely used phthalates, has been found to cause liver carcinogenicity in rodents and has also been classified by IARC as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Category 2B). Although, it is disputed if the mechanism involved (peroxisome proliferation) is relevant for humans (IARC, 2013). Even if phthalates were authorised for use as food contact materials in the European Union (EU) in 2011 (EC 10/2011), for the aforementioned reasons, DBP, DEHP and DIBP should not be placed on the market in the EU after July 2020 individually or in any combination, in concentrations equal or greater than 0.1% by weight of plasticised material (EU 2018/2005). Thus, various phthalate substitutes have emerged such as di(isononyl)cyclohexane‐1,2‐dicarboxylate (DINCH), tributyl O‐acetylcitrate, triethyl 2‐acetylcitrate, trihexyl O‐acetylcitrate (Schutze et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2019).In order to evaluate qualitatively or quantitatively the likely human exposure of biological, chemical and physical agents via food and PCPs, exposure assessment was performed. In exposure assessments the magnitude, frequency and duration of human exposure to a chemical agent is modelled and the different exposure pathways, as inhalation, ingestion of water or food and dermal contact for PCPs are taken into account. Exposure is a crucial aspect in risk assessment since if there is no exposure; even a serious health hazard can be classified as a non‐risk. In order to estimate chemical exposure, occurrence, product concentration data and use/consumption data are needed. A very popular tool to estimate exposure is probabilistic exposure assessment. Probabilistic analyses use more complicated modelling approaches than the deterministic (point estimates) and rely on distributions of data as input in place of single values. The outcome is a distribution of possible exposure estimates and assists in characterising variability and uncertainty providing an insight into the overall picture in the population. In this way, the outcome is influenced at a lesser degree from possible outliers leading to overestimation or underestimation of the actual exposure. The use of statistical methods, i.e. Monte Carlo simulations, also provides greater credibility in comparison with deterministic approaches and/or expert judgement, which may be led by subjectivity. Even though probabilistic methods can provide a more reliable exposure estimate, it should be mentioned that availability of consumption and exposure data is paramount and limited concentration data can lead to a higher uncertainty in the final exposure estimate.A biomonitoring study (BM) was performed in Norway between September 2016 and November 2017 as part of the EuroMix project financed by H2020 programme. The study included males and females, who recorded their food consumption (including weights), and cosmetic use and collected all 24 h urine for two non‐consecutive days (Husøy et al., 2019). The consumption data from this study along with the concentration data from the literature were used for the probabilistic exposure estimates for five phthalates for males and females on both days. The selected phthalates were di(2‐ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), di‐iso‐nonyl phthalate (DINP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), di‐n‐butyl phthalate (DBP) and butyl‐benzyl‐phthalate (BBP).The fellow has completed the objectives specified in the project proposal. By accomplishing this, the fellow gained experience in writing a project protocol, performing systematic literature review and acquired practical experience with probabilistic exposure modelling both for single and aggregate exposure. Moreover, the fellow gained theoretical and practical experience in R, along with statistical methods for data treatment. As the part of the results (dietary exposure) was presented at a conference in January 2020 organised by the Norwegian society for Pharmacology and Toxicology at Beitostølen. Phthalate exposure was estimated for food, PCPs and their aggregate and was compared with the measured phthalate metabolites found in the urine. Additionally, their risk was characterised not only for the individual compounds but also for the mixture. The outcome of these activities is going to be published in a peer review journal and the manuscript currently is in preparation. Additionally, part of the results (dietary exposure) were used as a chapter in the fellow's PhD thesis titled ‘New developments in harmonised risk assessment of emerging chemical hazards: Chemical mixtures’ for the University of Parma, which was the sending institute.An objective that was amended during the fellowship was the use of the Monte Carlo Risk Assessment tool (MCRA). Due to data protection issues, the fellow was able to use the tool only for training purposes. This did not affect the work outcome since the objectives were met by using R. Additionally the COVID‐19 pandemic did not significantly hinder the work progress, since there were frequent online interdepartmental meetings. Overall, the fellow did not have any adjustment issues; he integrated at the NIPH and collaborated well with colleagues from the Section of Toxicology and Risk Assessment.\n\n\n\n\nBBP\n\nbutyl‐benzyl‐phthalate\n\n\n\n\nBW\n\nbody weight\n\n\n\n\nDBP\n\ndi‐n‐butyl phthalate\n\n\n\n\nDEHP\n\ndi(2‐ethylhexyl) phthalate\n\n\n\n\nDEP\n\ndiethyl phthalate\n\n\n\n\nDINCH\n\ndi(isononyl)cyclohexane‐1,2-clicarboxylate\n\n\n\n\nDINP\n\ndi‐iso-nonyl phthalate\n\n\n\n\nEU‐FORA\n\nEuropean Food Risk Assessment Fellowship Programme\n\n\n\n\nIARC\n\nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer\n\n\n\n\nLB\n\nlower bound\n\n\n\n\nMB\n\nmiddle bound\n\n\n\n\nMCRA\n\nMonte Carlo Risk Assessment\n\n\n\n\nNIPH\n\nNorwegian Institute of Public Health\n\n\n\n\nOECD\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development\n\n\n\n\nPCPs\n\npersonal care products\n\n\n\n\nPVC\n\npolyvinyl chloride\n\n\n\n\nSCCS\n\nScientific Committee on Consumer Safety\n\n\n\n\nUB\n\nupper bound\n\n\n"

        "summary": "Food contact materials ( ) can contain chemicals that could migrate from the material itself to the foodstuff posing health concerns if ingested in non‐safe quantities by the consumer.   include containers, packaging, machinery or kitchenware and can be made from different materials like plastics, paper and board, metal or glass. Printing inks are also an important part of  .   have an important role in preventing damage or spoilage of the foodstuff and are essential along the food chain. Therefore, their safety needs to be carefully assessed in order to reduce the exposure to potentially hazardous substances and protect the health of the consumer. At the   level, the legislation on   establishes general safety requirements for  . In addition, for certain materials, specific measures concerning usage and release of substances have been set. For materials or articles not specifically regulated in this harmonised framework, safety must be proven on a case‐by‐case basis. National legislations and lists of substances evaluated by competent authorities are important data sources in this context. One of the most important databases are the ‘BfR Recommendations on Food Contact Materials’ and the soon to come German national regulation on printing inks. BfR Unit 74, besides dealing with chemical risk assessment of  , is responsible for the evaluation of application dossiers for including substances into the BfR recommendations on   or the substance list of the printing inks regulation. Through the proposed work programme the fellow has been involved in risk assessment of substances that migrate from   into foodstuff gaining experience in the methodologies used to perform the scientific data evaluation as well as to support the BfR Unit 74s work.",
        "full-text": "Food contact materials (FCM) are materials and articles intended to come into contact with food at any level of the food chain including processing, preparation, storage, serving, etc. Chemical substances used in the production of FCM are several thousand considering both intentionally added as well as known and unknown non‐intentionally added substances (NIAS) (Geueke et al., 2014). Migration of these substances or their breakdown or reaction products into foods can occur. In order to protect the consumer health an appropriate chemical risk assessment needs to be undertaken.The framework regulation for FCM is the regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 (European Commission, 2004) which lays down the general safety principles for all FCM – first of all, that FCM must not endanger human health. Another EU regulation, which FCM have to comply with, is regulation (EC) No 2023/2006 on ‘Good manufacturing practice’ (GMP) (European Commission, 2006a) that applies to all stages in their manufacturing chain. Besides the general legislation, specific European Union (EU) measures exist for some FCM such as plastic materials (also recycled), ceramics, regenerated cellulose films, active and intelligent materials as well as for some substances including bisphenol A, epoxy derivatives and nitrosamines. However, there are many materials and substances not specifically regulated in a harmonised way and in these cases risk assessment has to be conducted on a case by case basis.BfR Recommendations on Food Contact Materials (https://bfr.ble.de/kse/faces/DBEmpfehlung_en.jsp) represent a standard for the production of materials not subjected to any specific legislation and are well accepted by other European Commission member states according to the mutual recognition principle. BfR Recommendations are not legal norms but ‘reflect the current state of science and technology for the conditions under which consumer products made of high polymer materials meet the requirements of § 31.1 of the German Foods, Consumer Articles and Feed Act (LFGB) and Article 3.1 of Regulation (EC) 1935/2004 on Materials and Articles Intended to Come into Contact with Food as to their safety for human health’.The BfR unit 74 ‘Safety of Food Contact Materials’, where the fellow has been placed in, deals with risk assessment of chemical substances that migrate from FCM into food or food simulant. The unit is part of the Department 7 ‘Chemicals and Product Safety’ of the BfR that assesses substances in context of the REACH regulation and is involved in the assessment of the health risks relative to chemicals, cosmetics, FCM, toys and other consumer products.One important task of the BfR Unit 74 is to evaluate dossiers for including substances into the BfR Recommendations. The dossier evaluation process includes checking compliance with the requirements set by the EFSA ‘Note for Guidance For the Preparation of an Application for the Safety Assessment of a Substance to be used in Plastic Food Contact Materials’ (https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/rn-21) as well as assessing the scientific information provided by the applicant. The evaluated dossiers are then further discussed with external experts in the Panels ‘Toxicology’ and ‘Petitions’ of the BfR Committee for Consumer Products (BeKo). The unit elaborates also scientific opinions about health risk of substances who need a review or an up‐to‐date.Overall, the work programme allowed the fellow to get a deep insight into chemical risk assessment applied to food contact materials. Specifically, it has provided the fellow to experience the dossier evaluation procedure and the decision‐making process for the inclusion of substances into the ‘BfR recommendations on Food Contact Materials’. Then, other projects were performed: the risk assessment review for printing inks, that implied to retrieve relevant data from existing assessments with a specific attention given to their reliability, and the in silico genotoxicity prediction for styrene oligomers, that allowed the fellow to learn using in silico tools for the toxicological assessment of NIAS. Furthermore, some practical work in the NRL‐FCM has been performed to complete the training objectives.Beside the scientific training and achievements, the programme has been a unique opportunity for the fellow to build a strong network with the experts gaining a worthwhile experience and a growth mind‐set that will be valuable beyond the fellowship itself.The results of the in silico genotoxicity prediction of styrene oligomers are intended to be published in a peer‐review journal.

        "full-text": "The focus of the European Food Risk Assessment Fellowship Programme (EU‐FORA) is to provide hands‐on skills in chemical and microbiological risk analysis for food safety, especially focus on risk assessment, with an overview of risk management and risk communication.This specific project Study of the different evaluation areas in the pesticide risk assessment process was performed at the National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA), the unique Independent Evaluation Institution authorised in Spain to carry out the assessment in the areas of identity and physical‐chemical properties, methods of analysis, residues, fate and behaviour in the environment, ecotoxicology and efficacy in the field of the active substances, plant protection products (PPP), safeners and synergists (Resolución 2015, complying with Real Decreto 971/2014). While the Ministry of Health, Consumer Affairs and Social Welfare carries out the assessment in the area of human toxicology.In Spain, the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food is the National Competent Authority, in charge of the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 concerning the placing of PPPs on the market; while the competent authorities at Autonomous Community level are responsible for implementing all other controls (e.g. on marketing, maximum residue level (MRL)).Details of the Spanish organisation for authorisation and control of PPPs and residues are provided in the Appendix A.PPPs are pesticides that protect crops or desirable or useful plants. They are primarily used in the agricultural sector but also in forestry, horticulture, amenity areas and in‐home gardens. They contain at least one active substance and have one of the following functions: 1) protect plants or plant products against weeds, pests and diseases, before or after harvest; 2) influence the life processes of plants (such as substances influencing their growth, excluding nutrients); 3) preserve plant products; and 4) destroy or prevent growth of undesired plants or parts of plants.Pesticides contain and at least one active substance, such as any chemical, plant extract, pheromone or microorganism (including viruses), that has action against pests or on plants, parts of plants or plant products. They may also contain other components including safeners, synergists and co‐formulants.It is also important define the term pesticide, that is often used interchangeably with plant protection product. However, pesticide is a broader term which also covers non plant/crop uses, for example biocides. Nevertheless, the most common use of pesticides is in the form of PPPs.For active substances and PPPs (chemical and microbiological), respectively, a risk assessment must be carried out to ensure that these substances/products do not have harmful effects on human or animal health or unacceptable effects on the environment.The work follows the uniform principles for evaluation and authorisation of PPPs as in the wide EU legislation and guidelines which regulate the authorisation, use of PPPs and their residues in food. Those areas of evaluation are under responsibility of INIA.The first step of the work was the participation in the extensive training corpus iuris delivered by the coordination team of the Unidad de Productos Fitosanitarios (UPF) in INIA allowed to get a global view of the different areas of evaluation.This global view is a key point for interpreting the results of evaluations, with their uncertainty, in order to ensure that the chances of failing to detect adverse effects or of under‐estimating their importance are reduced to a minimum. All this picture shall be taken into consideration in the decision‐making process, identifying critical decision points or items of data for which uncertainties could lead to a false classification of risk.The training was complemented with the analysis of some specific cases for which Spain is the rapporteur Member State (RMS) in order to identify critical aspects of the risk assessment process when applied.Pesticide risk assessment is governed by hard and soft laws, with complex procedures involving many actors, and these procedures have been analysed to get the global view of the process.Specific areas of evaluation, within the remit of the UPF, such as method of analysis, efficacy, residues, ecotoxicology, environmental fate and behaviour, have been analysed. As result of this analysis, several points that should be improved have been highlighted, such as the coordination with other legislative areas, the effective strategies for replacement of substances of concern or how to use monitoring data, to reduce the risk assessment burden.In conclusion, this report has analysed regulations, guidance and procedures of the pesticide risk assessment in the areas of which the UPF in INIA is in charge. Finally, the report has highlighted some shortcoming of the process and has also proposed some ways to overcoming them, such as tools (EPRW, 2020), simplification procedures (SAPEA, 2018) and suggestion for the next European audits to be comprehensive of the whole process.\n\n\n\n\nEPPO\n\nEuropean and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization\n\n\n\n\nEPRW\n\nEuropean Pesticide Residues Workshop\n\n\n\n\nEQS\n\nenvironmental quality standard\n\n\n\n\nERO\n\necological recovery option\n\n\n\n\nETO\n\necological threshold option\n\n\n\n\nEU‐FORA\n\nEuropean Union Food Risk Assessment\n\n\n\n\nGAP\n\nGood Agricultural Practice\n\n\n\n\nGC–MS\n\ngas chromatography–mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nIPM\n\nIntegrated Pest Management\n\n\n\n\nLC–MS\n\nliquid chromatography–mass spectrometry\n\n\n\n\nLOQ\n\nlimit of quantification\n\n\n\n\nMRL\n\nmaximum residue level\n\n\n\n\nOECD\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development\n\n\n\n\nOJ\n\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n\n\n\n\nRAC\n\nregulatory acceptable concentration\n\n\n\n\nRMS\n\nrapporteur Member State\n\n\n\n\nSCoPAFF\n\nStanding Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed\n\n\n\n\nSPG\n\nspecific protection goals\n\n\n\n\nUS FDA\n\nUnited States Food Drug Administration\n\n\n\n\nWFD\n\nEU Water Framework Directive\n\n\n"
