Numerically, antibody\ntiters were hardly lower with tralokinumab than with placebo. However, the assay sensitivity of the selected serological endpoints was not demonstrated, and the data presented cannot rule out\npossible differences in the clinically relevant vaccination response.\nPatient exposure in the study programme\nIn placebo-controlled studies, a total of 1,991 patients receiving tralokinumab were compared with\n761 patients receiving placebo. The total tralokinumab exposure in these studies corresponded to\napproximately 1,404 patient-years, of which about 900 patient-years were directly placebo-controlled.\nPlacebo exposure equalled a total of 273 patient-years.\nThe exposure in the entire submitted clinical development of tralokinumab, including all investigated\napplications, was 3,054 patient-years, with a total of 4,281 exposed patients.\nAdverse events\nDeaths: In the placebo-controlled trials, a total of 2/1,605 deaths occurred with tralokinumab in\npatients with atopic dermatitis versus 0/680 with placebo. A causal relationship with the study\nmedication is unlikely in either case.\nTEAE frequency and pattern: Mild drug-related TEAEs were numerically more frequent with\ntralokinumab compared with placebo, whereas more severe TEAEs were less frequent. Compared to\nplacebo, local reactions, conjunctivitis (rarely also keratitis), upper respiratory tract infections and\nherpes simplex, headache and blood eosinophilia were more frequent.\nAntibodies: Antibodies to tralokinumab (ADAs) were evaluated in all clinical trials. ADAs were present\nin 4.4% of patients treated with tralokinumab and in 1.4% of tralokinumab-na\u00efve patients. Neutralising\nantibodies were observed in 0.9% and 0.5% of patients, respectively. An analysis of patients with\nADAs and their incidence/pattern of TEAEs does not indicate a signal.\nLaboratory changes: There was a slight increase in blood eosinophilia with tralokinumab treatment,\nbut this was usually asymptomatic.\nIn conclusion, mild TEAEs were slightly more frequent with tralokinumab than with placebo. The\ndifferences were mainly due to local reactions conjunctivitis/keratitis, herpes, viral infections and mild\nblood eosinophilia.\nThe experience to date is too limited to make reliable statements about rare but potentially prohibitive\nadverse drug reactions. Some theoretical risks of this antibody are listed below (not exhaustive):\n\u2212 Tralokinumab is an IgG4 antibody and based on the dose recommendation requested, preexisting IgG4 levels can be expected to double on average with treatment. IgG4 is quantitatively\nthe smallest immunoglobulin subclass. With large interindividual differences (0.01-1.4mg/mL) but\nindividually constant values, it amounts to only about 5% of the total immunoglobulins. Its function\nis unclear. The consequences of a permanent increase cannot be estimated at the present state\nof knowledge.\n\u2212 Malignancy: The exact significance of IL-13, especially for tumour defence, is not known. Due to\nthe relatively short treatment/observation period, the data presented leave the possibility of\nunfavourable long-term effects in this regard.",

The current standard treatments for AMD\ninclude the injection of inhibitors of vascular growth factor known as anti-VEGFs into the vitreous body\n(intravitreal surgical drug administration).\nTwo pivotal studies investigated brolucizumab 6 mg versus aflibercept 2 mg (Non-inferiority Design) in\npatients with choroidal neovascularisation secondary to age-related macular degeneration, who had\nnot previously been treated with anti-VEGF preparations. Study RTH258-C001 also included a group\nwith brolucizumab 3 mg, while study RTH258-C002 quantified the disease activity in order to\ninvestigate the ideal duration of the dosage intervals. The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as\n\"Change from Baseline in BCVA to Week 48\", the non-inferiority margin was -4 letters. The lower\nlimits for the 95% CI were -2.1 and -2.5 respectively, and demonstrated non-inferiority for both\ndosages according to the protocol.\nIn study RTH258-C002, the average improvements in BCVA after 48 weeks were 7.6 letters for\naflibercept 2 mg and 6.9 letters for brolucizumab 6 mg. The lower limit for the 95% CI was -2.4 letters.\nThese improvements were obtained after around 12 weeks and were maintained up to the 96-week\npoint. The results for the various secondary endpoints were qualitatively consistent with the primary\nendpoint. In both studies, after the loading dose over 50% of patients observed the 12-weekly\ntreatment intervals without any change in disease activity.\nUncertainty exists concerning the selected dosage. The dose/response relationship is flat and, in\nstudy RTH258-C001, since both 3 mg and 6 mg were non-inferior to the active control, the selected\n6 mg dose is not supported by solid evidence.\nIn the long-term population the incidences of ocular adverse events were low overall - these included\nconjunctival haemorrhages, vitreous detachments with floaters, pain and visual impairment - and,\nalthough overall comparable between the groups, were numerically elevated for inflammation, endophthalmitis and arterial occlusions. According to the investigators' narratives, most adverse\nevents tended to be caused by the intervention rather than the active substances. The absolute\ndifferences between the three groups (brolucizumab 3 mg, brolucizumab 6 mg and aflibercept 2 mg)\nwere relatively small. The rest of the safety data for the proposed 6 mg dosage of brolucizumab was\nslightly worse numerically than that of the reference preparation aflibercept 2 mg.\nThe formation of new anti-brolucizumab antibodies and the boostering of existing ones occurred\nduring treatment with brolucizumab.

        "summary": "The active substance glofitamab is a \"bi-specific monoclonal antibody\" (an immunologically effective protein). Glofitamab binds both to the tumour cells, by binding to the CD20 receptor (binding site) on the surface of B cells, and to the CD3 receptor on the surface of T cells (cells of the immune system). By binding simultaneously to CD20 on B cells and CD3 on T cells, there is direct contact between the tumour cells and T cells, leading to replication and activation of the T cells. Specific proteins that play a key role in immune defence are excreted as a result.\n\nThanks to this mechanism of action, the immune system can kill the target B cells, thereby inhibiting the growth of the cancer.",

        "full_text": "The safety database for QIV-HD, consisting of 1,777 +120 subjects from Study QHD00013 and\nQHD0008, was initially considered to be limited.\nGenerally, the approval of a new influenza vaccine would require a safety database consisting of\napproximately 3,000 subjects to fulfil the requirements of the EMA guideline\nCHMP/VWP/164653/2005 and EMA influenza guideline CHMP/VWP/457259/2014.\nConsiderable experience has been acquired with the TIV-HD vaccine, with a total of 25,564 subjects\nexposed to TIV-HD in clinical trials and approximately 104.5 million doses distributed (USA, Canada,\nand Australia) since 2009. However, there were concerns regarding the extent to which the safety data for the TIV-HD from clinical studies could be applied to the QIV-HD, as the manufacturing\nprocess had been changed since most of the TIV-HD studies were conducted, and the addition of the\nsecond B strain not only increased the HA content, but substantially augmented the total protein\ncontent, including impurities. Furthermore, the filling volume was also higher for QIV-HD compared to\nTIV-HD. For the listed reasons, with the exception of the post-marketing data of TIV-HD, the safety\nprofile needed to be characterised based on QIV-HD specific data.\nThe additionally requested Study QHD00011 submitted to Swissmedic with the answer to the\nPreliminary Decision compared the QIV-HD to a standard-dose QIV and provided relevant further\ninformation on the safety profile of the vaccine.\nStudy QHD00013\nAll subjects were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and any unsolicited systemic AEs\noccurring during that time were recorded as immediate unsolicited systemic AEs. Solicited reactions\nwere collected for 7 days after vaccination, and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were collected up to\nDay 28. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were collected\nup to Day 180 following vaccination.\nSafety results were analysed descriptively for subjects in the safety analysis set (SafAS) who received\nQIV-HD, TIV-HD1, and TIV-HD2. Solicited reactions (solicited injection site and systemic reactions),\nunsolicited AEs, SAEs, and AESIs were summarised.\nVery few subjects were discontinued from the study.\nWithin 7 days after vaccination, the percentages of subjects who reported at least 1 solicited injection\nsite reaction were 44.1% (779/1,768) and 39.8% (354/889) in the QIV-HD and TIV-HD pooled groups,\nrespectively. The most frequently reported solicited injection site reaction was pain, reported by\n41.3% in the QIV-HD and 36.4% and TIV-HD pooled groups.\nAlthough the percentage of subjects who reported at least one solicited reaction within 7 days after\nvaccination were similar between groups, Grade 2 and Grade 3 reactions were reported more often in\nthe QIV-HD group.\nThe few Grade 3 solicited injection site reactions were reported by 26 (1.5%) and 4 (0.4%) subjects in\nthe QIV-HD and TIV-HD pooled groups, and the reactions were pain 12 (0.7%) vs 2 (0.2%), erythema\n11 (0.6%) vs 2 (0.2%), swelling 5 (0.3%) vs 1 (0.1%) and induration 3 (0.2%) vs 1 (0.1%).\nThis slightly greater reactogenicity is most likely due to the higher HA (and other non-HA protein)\ncontent in the QIV-HD vs TIV-HD.\nThe most frequently reported solicited systemic reaction was myalgia, reported by 22.7% and 18.9%\nof subjects in the QIV-HD and TIV-HD pooled groups, respectively.\nThe percentages of SAEs and deaths in the study groups were similar. A total of 128 subjects\nexperienced 162 SAEs during the study.\nOne subject in the QIV-HD group developed small fibre inflammatory neuropathy 40 days after the\nvaccination. This was considered by the investigator to be related to the study vaccination, but was\nconsidered by the sponsor to be not related to the study vaccination since the event occurred more\nthan 1 month after vaccination (outside of the usual time window for the vast majority of vaccinerelated events) and in view of the other aetiologies reported (i.e., vitamin B12 deficiency and recent\nviral illness), which are more likely causes of the SAE.\nHowever, a causal relation to the vaccination cannot be ruled out.\nA total of 5 deaths were reported during the study. Two within 28 days: one in the QIV-HD group, 6\ndays after vaccination, reported as due to natural causes, although the subject was suspected to have\nMI, arrhythmia, or massive stroke; the second in the TIV-HD1 group 25 days after vaccination and\nassociated with myocardial infarction. This was a 75-year-old female with a history of CAD,\nhypercholesterinaemia, COPD, depression, and hypertension.\nDuring the 6-month follow-up period: QIV-HD: 168 days after vaccination: acute respiratory infection\nin a 75-year-old female patient with a history of COPD. She had been hospitalised due to acute exacerbation and died 5 days later. QIV-HD: 105 days after vaccination: prostate cancer with\nmetastasis, blood culture was positive for MSSA, died 6 days later. TIV-HD-1: 87 days after\nvaccination: pneumonia, 92-year-old male patient with a history of CAD, hypothyroidism, dementia,\nsleep apnoea, hypertension, peripheral oedema, oesophageal varices, oesophagitis and atrial\nfibrillation. On day 34 he was admitted to hospital for a syncopal episode and cough. He was\ndiagnosed with pneumonia and was discharged 2 days later on antibiotics. On day 87 pneumonia and\nsepsis were diagnosed in the hospital and he died 19 days later.\nAll deaths and AESIs were evaluated as unrelated to the study vaccination. Reported AESIs were few\nand distributed across the groups, although all (3) involved Bell\u2019s palsy. Bell\u2019s palsy is included in the\ndraft information for professional healthcare as a post-marketing AE of the trivalent vaccine.\nIn summary, in Study QHD00013 no new safety concerns were identified in QIV-HD versus TIV-HD,\nalthough a slightly greater reactogenicity was observed for the QIV-HD compared to the TIV-HD,\nwhich could be explained by the higher amount of HA and impurities.\nStudy QHD00011\nCollection of safety data:\n\u2022 All subjects were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination. Any unsolicited systemic adverse\nevents (AEs) occurring during that time were recorded as immediate unsolicited systemic AEs in the\nCase Report Book (CRB).\n\u2022 Solicited reactions were collected up to 7 days after vaccination (D0 to D7), and unsolicited AEs\nwere collected up to 28 days after vaccination (D0 to D28 [V02]). Subjects were to record this\ninformation in a diary card (DC).\n\u2022 Serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were, and continue\nto be, collected throughout the study (D0 up to approximately D180 [6-month follow-up period]).\nSubjects were asked to notify the site immediately of any potential SAEs (including AESIs) at any time\nduring the study.\n\u2022 Staff reviewed the V01 (D0) to V02 (D28) safety data with subjects at V02.\n\u2022 Subjects will continue to collect information on SAEs and AESIs in a memory aid (D28 [V02]-D180).\nAESIs will be captured as SAEs. These AESIs include new onset of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS),\nencephalitis / myelitis (including transverse myelitis), Bell\u2019s palsy, optic neuritis, and brachial neuritis.\n\u2022 Staff contact subjects by telephone at D180 post-vaccination to review the memory aid and to\nidentify the occurrence of any SAEs and AESIs that had not yet been reported.\n\u2022 Interactive response technology (IRT) was used to randomly assign subjects, in each age group, to\none of the two vaccine groups and to assign subject numbers in each of the groups.\n\u2022 Electronic data capture is used for the collection of data.\nSafety findings within 28 days of vaccination. Safety analysis were performed on the SafAS, which\nconsisted of a total of 1,533 subjects.\nIn the over 65 years old subgroup, which is pertinent to the approved indication, injection site\nreactions and systemic solicited reactions were reported with higher rates by the subjects who\nreceived QIV-HD vs the subjects who received QIV-SD (49.4% vs 28.3 % and 34.6% vs 26.2 %).\nRates of unsolicited AEs and adverse reactions (ARs) were also higher in the QIV-HD group vs the\nQIV-SD group.\nThe unsolicited non-serious ARs reported for the QIV-HD and QIV-SD groups were found to be\nsimilar in adults 60 to 64 years of age and adults 65 years of age and older.\nWithin 28 days of vaccination, one AE (intervertebral disc protrusion) reported by one subject (60 to\n64 years age group) in the QIV-HD group led to withdrawal from the study. This AE was assessed as\nnot related to the study vaccine by the Investigator.\nNo deaths or AESIs were reported within 28 days of vaccination.\nWithin 28 days of vaccination, a total of five SAEs were reported by five subjects in the QIV-HD group\nand five SAEs were reported by five subjects in the QIV-SD group.\nSAEs reported were acute myocardial infarction (16 hours 55 minutes after receipt of vaccine)\npilonidal cyst, cerebral thrombosis, transient ischaemic attack, and exacerbation of intermittent claudication in the QIV-HD group. The pilonidal case in the QIV-HD group and coronary artery\nstenosis and nephrolithiasis in the QIV-SD group were reported in subjects 60-64 years of age.\nCoronary artery stenosis, intestinal occlusion, rectal bleeding, polycythaemia vera, and nephrolithiasis\nwere reported in the QIV-SD group. None were considered to be related to the vaccine by the\ninvestigator. None of the SAEs led to study discontinuation.\nAs a post-authorisation requirement, six-month follow-up data will be submitted to allow further\nassessment of SAEs, deaths and AESIs.",

        "full_text": "Two main pivotal studies were submitted to support the application.\nQHD00013 (NCT03282240) assessed the safety and immunogenicity of Efluelda compared to the\nhigh-dose trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV-HD).\nStudy FIM12 was the pivotal efficacy study performed with the TIV-HD and assessed the efficacy\nagainst PCR proven Influenza like Illness (ILI) of the TIV-HD (Fluzone High-Dose) compared to a\nstandard-dose trivalent vaccine (Fluzone).\nAs requested by Swissmedic, Study QHD00011 was additionally submitted with the response to the\nPreliminary Decision. The request was mainly driven by the need to further expand the safety\ndatabase for QIV-HD. Study QHD00013\nQHD00013 was a randomised, modified double-blind, active-controlled, multi-centre study conducted\nin 2,670 healthy subjects aged 65 years and older.\nThe study was conducted from September 2017 to April 2018 at 35 centres in the US.\nThe comparator high-dose trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV-HDs) contained either the B strain from the\nprimary lineage (TIV-HD1, which was the licensed vaccine [Fluzone\u00ae High- Dose] for the 2017-2018\nNorthern Hemisphere influenza season) or the B strain from the alternate lineage (TIV-HD2, which\nwas an investigational TIV-HD containing an alternate B strain).\nSubjects were randomised into 3 groups in a 4:1:1 ratio: QIV-HD, TIV-HD1, and TIV-HD2.\nSubjects were also randomly assigned to the Expanded Immunogenicity Subset for seroneutralisation\n(SN) testing and enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) via interactive response technology (IRT). A\nsubset of approximately 100 subjects per treatment groups was identified just after the completion of\nthe enrolment.\nDue to the different filling volumes of the vaccines (0.7 ml for QIV-HD and 0.5 ml for the TIV-HD) an\nunblinded administrator at each site who was not involved in any of the blinded assessments\nadministered the vaccine. The subjects did not know which product was administered.\nThe inclusion and eligibility criteria used are considered appropriate.\nSubject demographics were balanced between the groups, with the exception of gender, as there\nwere more females (57.9% vs 42.1% males in the PPAS). Most of the subjects (74.3%), as expected,\nhad received influenza vaccination in the previous season, and the rates of subjects among the\ngroups were similar. Pre-vaccination hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) GMTs and seroprotection rates\nwere similar between the groups for all strains.\nOut of the 2,670 randomised subjects, 16 (0.6%) subjects did not complete the study: 10 (0.6%), 3\n(0.7%), and 3 (0.7%) subjects in the QIV-HD, TIV-HD1, and TIV-HD2 groups, respectively.\nTwo subjects each in the QIV-HD and TIV-HD1 groups withdrew due to an AE.\nOther reasons for discontinuation were lost to follow-up (3 subjects in the QIV-HD group), protocol\ndeviation (4, 1 and 2 subjects in the QIV-HD, TIV-HD1, and TIV-HD2 groups, respectively), and\nvoluntary withdrawal by subject not due to an adverse event (AE) (1 subject each in the QIV-HD and\nTIV-HD2 groups).\nThe primary objective was to demonstrate that Efluelda induces an immune response (as assessed\nby HAI geometric mean titres [GMTs] and seroconversion rates) that is non-inferior to responses\ninduced by TIV-HD1 and TIV-HD2 for the 4 virus strains at 28 days post-vaccination in all subjects.\nSecondary objectives were:\n- To demonstrate that each B strain in the QIV-HD induces an immune response (as assessed by\nHAI GMTs and seroconversion rates) that is superior to the response induced by the TIV-HD that\ndoes not contain the corresponding B strain in all subjects.\n- To describe the immune response induced by QIV-HD, TIV-HD1, and TIV-HD2 by the HAI\nmeasurement method in all subjects.\n- To describe the immune response 28 days after vaccination by the virus SN measurement\nmethod in a randomised subset of subjects from each study group.\n- To describe the safety profiles of all subjects in each trial group.\nFor the A strains, the primary objective was evaluated using pooled data from TIV-HD1 and TIV-HD2\ngroups. For each of the B strains, the primary objective was evaluated based on the TIV-HD group\ncontaining the corresponding B strain.\nThe primary objective of non-inferiority of QIV-HD to TIV-HD as assessed by GMTs and\nseroconversion rates was met, as the lower limit of the 95% CI was above 0.667 for the ratio of\nGMTs and above -10% for the differences of seroconversion rates for all influenza strains.\nThe predefined non-inferiority margins were acceptable.\nFor a tabulated presentation of the primary endpoint results please see the \u201cEfficacy\u201d section of the\ninformation for healthcare professionals.\nThe secondary immunogenicity objective, to demonstrate that each B strain in QIV-HD induces\nsuperior immune response (as assessed by HAI GMTs and seroconversion rates) to the response\ninduced by the TIV-HD that does not contain the corresponding B strain, was met, as the lower limit of the 95% CI was above 1.5 for the ratios of GMTs and above 10% for the seroconversion rates for\nboth B influenza strains.\nFor the QIV-HD, TIV-HD1, and TIV-HD2 groups, the percentages of subjects who achieved\nseroprotection were 95.1%, 96.7%, and 95.6% against the A/H1N1 strain, respectively; 96.9%,\n96.9%, and 96.7% against the A/H3N2 strain, respectively; 99.0%, 99.1%, and 96.5% against the\nB/Brisbane strain, respectively; and 99.3%, 96.7%, and 99.1% against the B/Phuket strain,\nrespectively.\nOf note, seroprotection rates for those B strains that are not included in the respective TIV-HD1 or\nTIV-HD2 were similar to the seroprotection rates for the B strain that is included in the vaccine. This\nmight be the result of cross-reactive antibodies.\nImmunogenicity assessed by covariate factors showed lower post-vaccination GMTs and\nseroconversion rates for subjects over 75 years of age compared to subjects 65-75 years of age.\nFurther subgroup analysis showed higher post vaccination GMTs and seroconversion rates in female\nthan in male subjects and in subjects with no history of previous influenza vaccination the prior year\ncompared to subjects with a history of an influenza vaccination the prior year.\nGMTs (pre- and post-vaccination), geometric mean titre ratios (GMTRs), and fold rises (2- and 4-fold)\nwere similar among all study groups for both influenza A strains and for each of the B strains when\nQIV-HD is compared with the corresponding TIV-HD containing the same B strain when measured by\nthe SN assay.\nThe anti-NA Ab response against the N1 antigen in the A/H1N1 strain and N2 antigen in the A/H3N2\nstrain was assessed by ELLA as an additional immunogenicity analysis. The clinical relevance of the\nimmune response measured by the neutralisation and ELLA assays is currently not fully understood;\nfurthermore, there is no correlate of protection established either for the neutralising antibody titres, or\nfor the antibody response against the neuraminidase.\nIn summary, Efluelda in subjects over 65 years of age demonstrated non-inferior immunogenicity\ncompared to TIV-HD.\nStudy FIM12\nFIM12 was a phase III/IV, randomised, modified double-blind multicentre efficacy study conducted in\nthe USA and Canada with the licensed TIV-HD in healthy adults >65 years without moderate-tosevere acute illness.\nThe efficacy was assessed over two seasons, the first season enrolled 14,500 subjects (7,254 TIVHD, 7,246 TIV); the second season enrolled 17,489 subjects (8,737 TIV-HD, 8,752 TIV).\nThere was one primary endpoint with a statistical hypothesis: \u201cOccurrences of culture- or PCRconfirmed influenza (\u2265 14 days post-vaccination) caused by any influenza viral type/subtype, in\nassociation with a protocol-defined ILI.\u201d\nThe per protocol ILI definition included low-grade fever >37.2\u00b0C in combination of 2 of multiple\nsymptoms (e.g. wheezing and headache without cough and without sore throat). This was not fully in\nline with the CDC (>37.2\u00b0C and cough or sore throat) or with the WHO 2014 ILI definition of fever\n>38.0\u00b0C1\n. For the primary endpoint, Fluzone High-Dose would be considered superior to Fluzone if\nthe lower bound of the CI for relative VE was > 9.1%; 95% of enrolled subjects were evaluable for\nrelative VE.\nThe primary endpoint with the per protocol ILI definition was fulfilled with 24.24% (95% CI 9.69; 36.52)\ncombined over 2 years. Of note, the lower boundary of the 95% CI was not >9.1% for year 1 and 2\nseparately, and the additional primary analyses with modified CDC-defined influenza-like illness\ncriteria and with ILI definition associated with respiratory illness were both not statistically significant.\nAs there were no statistical hypotheses or corrections for multiple testing regarding any of the\nsecondary or observational endpoints or the exploratory endpoints, including effectiveness data on\n 1 https://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/ili_sari_surveillance_case_definition/en/ hospitalisations and pneumonia, these are not presented in the information for healthcare\nprofessionals.\nFIM12 was the successor study of Study FIM07, which was a randomised, double-blind, activecontrolled, multi-centre trial assessing the relative efficacy of TIV-HD to that of TIV-SD in adults 65\nyears of age and older, with respect to laboratory-confirmed influenza illness caused by viral\ntypes/subtypes antigenically similar to those contained in the respective annual vaccine formulations.\nAs the primary endpoint regarding matching influenza strains could not be reached due to the A/H1N1\nswine flu pandemic in 2009, the study was terminated earlier than planned, after one season.\nStudy QHD00011\nStudy QHD00011 compared the immunogenicity and safety of Efluelda to a standard-dose\nquadrivalent influenza vaccine approved in Switzerland. This was a phase III, randomised, modified\ndouble-blind, multicentre study conducted in Europe with approximately 1,540 healthy adults (770\nadults 60 to 64 years of age and 770 adults 65 years of age and older).\nThe primary objective of superiority of QIV-HD to QIV-SD as assessed by HAI GMTs was met, as the\nlower limit of the two-sided 95% CI was above 1 for the ratio of GMTs for all influenza strains in each\nage group. A stringent superiority criterion, as defined by a lower bound of the 95% CI for the ratio of\ngeometric mean HAI titres of >1.5, would have been preferable.\nThe immunogenicity results for subjects over 65 years of age are presented in a tabulated form in the\ninformation for healthcare professionals.\nSeroconversion and seroprotection rates in both vaccine groups met the CBER criteria (lower bound\nof the two-sided 95% CI for the percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion for HI antibodies\nshould meet or exceed 30%, and the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the percentage of\nsubjects achieving an HI antibody titre \u2265 1:40 should meet or exceed 60%) for all strains in subjects\nolder than 65 years of age. The rates of seroconversion and seroprotection were, in most cases,\nnumerically higher for the QIV-HD group. See also Table 2 in the information for healthcare\nprofessionals for the details.\nThe immunogenicity/safety and the efficacy of the TIV-HD compared to standard-dose influenza\nvaccine is relevant, as the higher HA content included in the vaccine needs to be justified with the\ndemonstration of added benefit for the vaccinated population, especially taking into account the\nhigher rate of reactogenicity due to the increased HA amount and the consequently higher amount of\nimpurities\nSupportive Study conducted with TIV-HD- FIM05\nStudy FIM05, after having demonstrated the consistency of three different lots of TIV-HD, assessed\nas the second primary objective the immunogenicity of the TIV-HD (Fluzone-HD) - pooled data from\nthe three lots - compared to standard-dose TIV (Fluzone). The criterion of superiority was met for both\nseroconversion and GMT ratios as, according to the protocol, it was sufficient to show superiority for\ntwo of the three vaccine strains and non-inferiority for the third strain.\nSuperiority could not be demonstrated for the TIV-HD vaccine over the standard-dose trivalent\nvaccine for the B strain, based on any of the predefined criteria (seroconversion, GMT ratios). For the\nB strain non-inferiority criteria were met. ",
        "summary": "Two studies (QHD00013 and FIM12) were submitted with the authorisation documents.\n\nStudy QHD00013 investigated the safety and immunogenicity[2] of Efluelda compared to the trivalent high-dose flu vaccine (TIV-HD) in more than 2,000 healthy adults aged over 65. The study showed that Efluelda induced a level of immunogenicity in over-65-year-olds that was no weaker compared to TIV-HD.\n\nStudy FIM12 investigated the efficacy of TIV-HD. The study was conducted in healthy adults aged over 65 who received TIV-HD or a vaccine at a standard dosage (Fluzone). The efficacy was observed over two seasons in a total of more than 30,000 study participants. The efficacy of TIV-HD proved to be superior to that of the standard-dose vaccine.\n\nIn addition to the data from the two studies QHD00013 and FIM12 described above, data from the still ongoing study QHD00011 have also been reviewed by Swissmedic.

Vaccination, especially for risk groups that have a higher chance of experiencing\ncomplications or more severe influenza disease, is recommended by several medical organisations,\nsocieties, and national immunisation technical advisory groups in order to reduce the influenzaassociated morbidity and mortality.\nThe burden of influenza infection and complications is the highest in older adults over 65 years.\n\u201cApproximately 90% of influenza-related deaths and 50-70% of influenza-related hospitalisations\noccur among people in this age group in the US. Because of their increased risk, older adults are a\npriority group for vaccination.\u201d2\nIn support of this current application, the company submitted a comprehensive dossier. Two studies\nwere considered pivotal for the application.\nStudy FIM12 evaluated the efficacy of the TIV-HD relative to standard-dose TIV regarding any\nPCR/culture-proven protocol defined ILI in the elderly. The primary endpoint for demonstrating\nsuperiority with the per protocol ILI definition was fulfilled with 24.24% (95% CI 9.69; 36.52) combined\nover 2 years, as the lower boundary of of the 95% CI exceeded the pre-defined threshold of 9.1%.\nThe other pivotal study, QHD00013, was intended to bridge the QIV-HD to the TIV-HD by\ndemonstrating comparable immunogenicity and safety profiles. Study QHD00013 met its primary\nobjectives, demonstrating that QIV-HD was non-inferior to TIV-HD1 and TIV-HD2 as assessed by the\nHAI GMTs and seroconversion rates for all four strains on day 28 post-vaccination.\nThe seroprotection rates were high for all strains at 28 days after vaccine administration for the QIVHD vaccine, ranging from 95.1-99.3%.\nStudy QHD00013 reached its endpoints for making the immunological bridging possible and allowed\nthe efficacy data obtained with the TIV-HD vaccine to be inferred to the QIV-HD.\nIn Study QHD00013, one of the pivotal studies supporting this application, QIV-HD demonstrated\nnon-inferior immunogenicity for all four strains as assessed by the GMTs and seroconversion at 28\ndays post-vaccination compared to TIV-HD. In case of the A strains, comparison was made to the\npooled data of the two TIV-HDs containing one of the B types and, in case of the B strains to the TIVHD with the corresponding B type.\nFor the two B strains, superiority as assessed by the GMTs and seroconversion rates could be\ndemonstrated compared to the vaccines with the alternate B type. The seroprotection rates were\nsimilar for the vaccine groups for all strains. These results of Study QHD00013 demonstrated that the\nimmunogenicity of the QIV-HD vs TIV-HD is comparable, and that the additional B type does not\ninterfere with the immune response of the other strains in a mostly pre-vaccinated elderly population.\nAs well as demonstrating comparable immunogenicity of the QIV-HD to the TIV-HD vaccines, Study\nQHD00013 was intended to provide immunological bridging to the TIV-HD.\nVaccines used in the pivotal efficacy study performed with the TIV-HD vaccine (FIM12) was\nconducted with vaccines manufactured with the legacy process and the control vaccine in Study\nQHD00013 with the current process.\n 2 https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2018-2019/hopitalization-rates-older.html Comparability of the vaccine products has been evaluated by quality attributes, although it would have\nbeen preferable to demonstrate the comparability by clinical studies.\nWith its answer to the Preliminary Decision, the company submitted results from Study QHD00011\nassessing the immunogenicity and safety of QIV-HD to a standard dose quadrivalent influenza\nvaccine approved in Switzerland.\nThe submission did not provide data on clinical efficacy or effectiveness data specific to the QIV-HD.\nFurthermore, data on the co-administration of the QIV-HD or the TIV-HD with other vaccines were not\navailable.\nSubjects in Study FIM05 who received TIV-HD had higher rates of solicited reactions compared to\nsubjects who received standard-dose TIV, which was mostly driven by the higher rates of solicited\ninjection site reactions.\nTIV-HD was non-inferior to standard Fluzone for the systemic reactions of headache, malaise, and\nmyalgia, and was inferior for \u201cmoderate or severe\u201d fever.\nIn Study QHD00013, no new safety concerns were identified for QIV-HD compared to TIV-HD,\nalthough a slightly greater reactogenicity was observed with the QIV-HD. This could be explained by\nthe higher amounts of HA and impurities. No imbalances in the frequency or severity of unsolicited\nadverse events were observed between the groups, and serious or uncommon conditions were not\nobserved at unexpectedly high frequencies in any group.\nIn Study QHD00011, injection site reactions and systemic solicited reactions were reported at higher\nrates by the subjects who received QIV-HD vs the subjects who received QIV-SD, and the rates of\nunsolicited AEs and ARs were also numerically higher in the QIV-HD group vs the QIV-SD group.\nSix-month safety data are still missing, as data collection was still ongoing at the time of submission\nof the response to the Preliminary Decision.\nThe information for healthcare professionals and the RMP were updated with the data based on the\nresults of the study. The company confirmed the implementation of the annual \"Enhanced safety\nsurveillance\" (EPSS) activities and committed to submit a PSUR/PBRER annually. Additionally, the\nfinal clinical study report for QHD00011 is the subject of a post authorisation requirement.\nThe safety profile of Efluelda is adequate, and the higher reactogenicity compared to the standarddose quadrivalent influenza vaccine and also to the TIV-HD can be accepted.\nOverall, the benefit/risk for Efluelda for adults over 65 years of age with the approved indication is\nconsidered to be positive based on the submitted data.\nIn the absence of specific efficacy studies with Efluelda, non-inferior immunogenicity results\ndemonstrated comparability with the TIV-HD. This immunobridging of the QIV-HD to the TIV-HD\nallowed the efficacy results demonstrated for the TIV-HD to be applied to Efluelda.\nThe additionally submitted QHD00011 study provided further relevant confirmatory information on the\nimmunogenicity and safety of Efluelda compared to a standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine.\nAs a post-authorisation requirement the final study report for Study QHD00011, including the sixmonth follow-up safety data, will be submitted to allow further assessment of SAEs, deaths and\nAESIs.",

The TNBC safety pool (366\npatients) comprises the patients from study IMMU-132-05 and IMMU-132-01 with TNBC and two prior\nlines of treatment. The IMMU-132-01 study had enrolled 144 patients with TNBC, however, those\npatients who had not received two prior lines of treatment in the metastatic setting were not included\nin the TNBC pool but in the all-treated SG safety pool (660 patients).\nExposure\nTreatment duration was similar between the randomised phase 3 study IMMU-132-05 (4.4 months)\nand all SG treated patients (4.1 months), and longer than for control patients (1.3 months). Dose\nreductions were observed in approximately 30% of all SG safety pools, and most patients had only\none dose reduction. Mean dose intensity was >90%, and the median dose intensity was >98% for all\nsafety pools (IMMU-132-05, TNBC, and all). Most patients discontinued treatment due to progressive\ndisease (PD), 84% in the TNBC safety pool and 75% in the all-treated safety pool. However, in the\ncontrol arm of the phase 3 IMMU-132-05 study, 8% of patients discontinued due to withdrawal of\nconsent. Only 3.8% of patients discontinued SG for adverse events (AEs) in the TNBC pool and 6.8%\nin the all-treated safety pool.\nIn study IMMU-132-05, AEs leading to treatment interruptions were more frequent in the SG arm\n(63%) compared to the control arm (39%). Most frequent reasons for treatment interruption were\nhaematological toxicity (despite higher use of GCSF in the SG arm compared to the control arm),\ninfectious complications and gastrointestinal toxicity (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting). These frequencies\nwere similar in all safety pools.\nIncidence of AEs\nTreatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (98% vs 86%), TEAEs of \u2265 grade 3 (75% vs 65%), and\nTEAEs leading to study drug interruption (55% vs 39%) were more frequent in the SG safety pools\ncompared to the control arm of the IMMU-132-05 study (TPC). Serious TEAEs were similar in\nincidence in the two TNBC safety pools (~27%) and comparable with the incidence in the control arm\n(28%) of the phase 3 study for TNBC. However, in the all-SG treated safety pool, the incidence of\nserious AEs (SAEs) was higher (35%).\nMost frequent AEs\nThe most frequent AEs were gastrointestinal toxicity, haematological toxicity and general conditions.\nThe preferred terms were diarrhoea (64%), nausea (67%), vomiting (40%), constipation (38%),\nabdominal pain (22%), neutropenia (61%), anaemia (41%), fatigue (52%), headache (17%),\nalopecia (44%), and rash (21%). The frequencies of these AEs were comparable between the three\nsafety pools. All of these AEs were considered treatment-related.\nGrade 3/4 AEs\nThere were only a few grade 4 AEs and mostly involved neutropenia. In the IMMU-132-05 study,\nthere was one grade 4 nausea and 1 grade 4 vomiting AE. Grade 3 diarrhoea was observed in 11%\nof patients in the IMMU-132-05 study, grade 3 neutropenia (including neutrophil count decreased) in\n28%, grade 3 anaemia in 9% and grade 3 nausea and abdominal pain in 3% of patients in each case.\nDeaths\nIn the all-patient safety pool, there were 12 on-treatment deaths. There was one death considered\ntreatment-related in the all-treated SG safety pool, but none in the TNBC safety pool. The one death\nconsidered treatment-related in the all-treated safety pool was due to an aspiration pneumonia in a\npatient with NSCLC who had presented nausea after each administration of SG.\nSerious AEs\nIn the IMMU-132-05 study, the overall incidence of SAEs was similar between the two treatment\narms. In the SG arm, more patients had febrile neutropenia (5%), diarrhoea (3.5%) and\npneumonia (2.7%).

        "full_text": "The applicant submitted one pivotal study (IMMU-132-05) and one supportive study (IMMU-132-01)\nfor the requested indication.\nPivotal study IMMU-132-05\nIMMU-132-05 is a 1:1 randomised, open-label, phase 3 study comparing sacituzumab govitecan (SG)\nwith treatment of the physician\u2019s choice (TPC) in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer\n(mTNBC) having received at least two prior lines of systemic chemotherapy, one of which could have\nbeen in the (neo)adjuvant setting, for their disease including a taxane. TPC consisted of single-agent\nchemotherapy (eribulin, capecitabine, gemcitabine or vinorelbine), all of which are standard\ntreatments in this disease setting. Investigators had to determine the chemotherapy agent before\nrandomisation. Treatment was continued until progression, toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death,\nwhichever occurred first.\nThe primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by an\nindependent review committee (IRC), in patients without known brain metastases at baseline (BM-\nneg). Secondary endpoints were PFS in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, overall survival (OS) in\nthe ITT and in the BM-neg population, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR),\nquality of life and safety.\nPatients were stratified according to prior number of treatment lines (2-3 vs >3), geographic location\n(North America versus Rest of the World) and presence or absence of known brain metastases at\nbaseline. The number of patients with known and stable brain metastases at baseline was limited to\n15%.\nIt is important to note that approximately 25-27% of mTNBC patients develop brain metastases over\nthe course of their disease [11] and therefore a cap of 15% is not representative of the true incidence\nof brain metastases in these patients.\nThe study included women or men with metastatic TNBC, defined as <1% ER and PR and HER2-\nnegative. Measurable disease was required. Patients with brain metastases were allowed if previously\ntreated and stable. Patients had received a minimum of two prior lines of systemic treatment for\nunresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (regardless of whether the breast cancer\nwas triple negative at that time or not). If patients relapsed within 12 months of (neo)adjuvant\ntreatment, the (neo)adjuvant regimen was counted as one line of prior therapy. PARP-inhibitor\ntherapy in BRCA-mutated patients was considered as a treatment line. Patients must have received a\nprior taxane unless they were intolerant to it or had a contraindication. Patients also had to present an\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, have adequate organ\nfunction, no residual toxicities and a life expectancy of 3 months or greater.\nExclusion criteria were numerous. Patients with Gilbert\u2019s disease were excluded based on the known\nrisk of toxicity to irinotecan in these patients and the SN-38 payload of SG, which is the active\nmetabolite of irinotecan. Prior malignancies were allowed with at least 3 years of disease-free interval.\nActive inflammatory bowel disease and history of bowel obstruction were exclusion criteria, as was\nany history of clinically significant bleeding.\nOverall, inclusion and exclusion criteria are reasonable. They certainly lead to a selection bias\nbecause patients with heavily pre-treated mTNBC have a very short median OS. However, clinically,\nonly patients in good general condition despite the advanced disease will be offered another line of\ntreatment. Therefore, the patient selection criteria still reasonably reflect the population. However,\nmore than 15% of patients with mTNBC after two or more prior treatment lines will have brain\nmetastases, and these were not adequately represented in this study.\nSG was administered on days 1 and 8 of 21-day treatment cycles until progression or toxicity. The\nsingle-agent chemotherapy drugs constituting the TPC were administered at registered doses and\nintervals.\nRadiologic assessment was performed every 6 weeks until 36 weeks and every 9 weeks thereafter by\ncomputed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Only patients with known brain\nmetastases at baseline had brain MRIs.\nStatistics\nA hazard ratio (HR) of 0.667, likely corresponding to a 50% improvement in PFS, was considered to\nbe clinically meaningful in this relapsed/refractory locally advanced or metastatic TNBC patient\npopulation. A total of 488 patients were anticipated to be enrolled. The population of patients with\nbrain metastases was limited to 15% (N=74) of the study population. The primary PFS analysis was\nperformed when 425 investigator-defined PFS events had occurred in all randomised patients,\nprovided 315 or more PFS events by IRC review had also occurred in the primary analysis population\n(i.e., BM-neg population). Assuming that 15% of patients at most had brain metastasis and that there\nwere 13% or fewer PFS events by IRC assessment than by investigator assessment, it was expected\nthat there would be at least 315 PFS events by IRC assessment in the BM-neg population at the time\n425 PFS events by investigator assessment were observed in all randomised patients. If the true HR\nwas 0.667 in the IRC review of the BM-neg population, the study had at least 95% power to detect a\nstatistically significant improvement in PFS, with a two-sided type 1 error rate of 5%, if data were\nanalysed after 315 PFS events by IRC assessment. OS was analysed at the time of PFS analysis and\nalso after 330 deaths had occurred in the BM-neg population. The study had approximately 89.5%\npower to detect an improvement in OS in the BM-neg population, with a two-sided 5% type 1 error\nrate, assuming that 72% of the planned number of deaths in BM-neg population had occurred at the\ntime of the interim analysis (i.e., 238 deaths) and the true HR for OS was 0.7.\nThe overall type I error rate was controlled by a hierarchical testing strategy. The primary endpoint of\nPFS by IRC assessment was analysed and tested first in the BM-neg population. If the primary\nanalysis test was significant, subsequent key secondary endpoints (OS in the BM-neg population,\nPFS by IRC assessment in the ITT population, OS in the ITT population) were tested in a sequential\nmanner, where a given hypothesis was only declared statistically significant if all hypotheses above it\nin the hierarchy were also statistically significant.\nThe protocol was amended six times. The most important amendments were an increase in sample\nsize from 328 to 488 and, in Amendment 5, the removal of the interim futility analysis.\nAssumptions for PFS and OS are reasonable, and the statistical analysis plan is adequate.\nResults: Study Population\nThe study screened 730 patients, and 529 patients were randomised, 267 to SG and 262 to TPC.\nMost patients did not have brain metastases at baseline, and only 61 patients with known brain\nmetastases were randomised. In total, 32 patients were randomised to SG and 29 to TPC. In the\ncontrol arm, 38 (14.5%) patients were randomised but did not receive treatment.\nAt the time of study completion (11 March 2020), 15 patients (6.4%) were still on study treatment in\nthe SG arm versus none in the control arm. The most common reasons for study discontinuation in\nthe control arm were death (76%) and withdrawal of consent (10%). These were also the main\nreasons for study discontinuation in the SG arm, but to a lesser extent (64% death, 3% withdrawal of\nconsent).\nBaseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between the two arms. Only two\nmale patients were enrolled in the study and they were both randomised to the SG arm. Nearly all\npatients (95%) had prior breast cancer surgery. Approximately 27% had received prior PD-1/PD-L1\ntherapy and 80% had prior (non-brain) radiotherapy.\nOverall, patients in the SG arm received concomitant medication more frequently compared to\npatients in the control arm. Some of these medications reflect the use of corticosteroids and anti-\nhistamines to prevent infusion reactions. However, there was also more use of anti-emetics, likely\nreflecting the emetogenic potential of SG. Nearly half of the patients in the SG arm (46.4%) received\ngranulocyte colony stimulating factors (GCSF) compared to just under 20% of patients in the control\narm. Patients in the SG arm also received more antibacterial and antiviral medication. Overall, there\nwas an important imbalance between the two treatment arms, with a large number of medications\nbeing administered more frequently in the SG arm.\nResults: Efficacy\nThe IRC-assessed median PFS in the brain metastases-negative (BM-neg) population is 5.6 months\n(95% CI: 4.3, 6.3) in the SG arm versus 1.7 months (95% CI: 1.5, 2.6) in the control arm. This\nobserved benefit of 3.9 months PFS with an HR of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.52) is statistically significant\n(p <0.0001) and clinically meaningful in this heavily pre-treated patient population. No PFS benefit is\nobserved in the small group of patients with brain metastases. Median PFS is 2.8 months (95% CI:\n1.5, 3.9) in the SG arm versus 1.6 months (95% CI: 1.3, 2.9) in the control arm. All sensitivity\nanalyses performed for PFS are consistent with the primary analysis. All subgroups independent of\nage, race, number of prior therapies, and region of the world, Trop-2 expression, and presence or\nabsence of liver metastases show a benefit for SG over control.\nThe secondary endpoint of PFS in the ITT population also shows a statistically significant PFS benefit\nof SG over TPC, with 4.8 months median PFS versus 1.7 months, respectively. The HR is 0.43 (95%\nCI 0.35, 0.54) with a p-value of <0.0001. However, this finding is expected given the 15% enrolment\ncap on brain metastases-positive patients. Therefore, the additional patients in the ITT population are\nunlikely to change the finding of the majority of patients without brain metastases.\nThe secondary endpoint of OS in BM-neg patients was also reached. Median OS is 12.1 months\n(95% CI: 10.7, 14.0) in the SG arm versus 6.7 months (95% CI: 5.8, 7.7) in the control arm. The HR is\n0.48 (95% CI: 0.38, 0.59) and the p-value <0.0001. In the ITT population, median OS is 11.8 months\nin the SG arm and 6.9 months in the control arm. As for PFS, no benefit was observed in the small\nbrain metastases-positive population, with a median OS of 6.8 months (95% CI: 4.7, 14.1) in the SG\narm versus 7.5 months (95% CI: 4.7, 11.1) in the control arm. The HR is 0.87 (95% CI: 0.47, 1.63).\nOther secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). SG\nwas superior to TPC in these secondary endpoints.\nSupportive study IMMU-132-001\nThe supportive study IMMU-132-01 was a phase 1/2 dose-finding and dose-expansion study. It\nincluded 144 patients with TNBC, of whom 108 had received at least two prior lines of treatment for\nmetastatic disease. The recommended phase 2 dose was 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 of 21-day\ncycles.\nResults from this study show an ORR of 33%, a clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 45%, a median PFS of\n5.6 months and a median OS of 13.0 months. While this is an uncontrolled study, the results are\nconsistent with those observed in the randomised phase 3 study and are considered supportive.",

The primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients without\nknown brain metastases at baseline was reached, with an improvement of 3.9 months, from 1.7 to 5.6\nmonths median PFS. The hazard ratio is 0.41 and the result is highly statistically significant and\nclinically meaningful. In addition, OS was also significantly improved from 6.7 to 12.1 months in the\nbrain metastases-negative patient population. This 5.4 month benefit in OS is statistically significant\nand clinically meaningful.\nPatients with brain metastases were only allowed to enrol if they had stable lesions, and a maximum\nof 15% of patients with brain metastases were allowed. The study enrolled 61 patients with brain\nmetastases of whom 29 were randomised to the control arm and 32 to the SG arm. There was no\napparent benefit of SG over control in PFS or OS in this small population. This finding is adequately\nreflected in the information for healthcare professionals.\nAlthough SG is an antibody-drug conjugate, the toxicity profile is linked to the drug moiety of SN-38,\nwith diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, haematological toxicity with neutropenia and\nanaemia as well as fatigue. Electrolyte imbalances are also observed, likely due - at least in part - to\ndiarrhoea. Alopecia is observed in nearly half of all patients and is mostly of grade 2 (complete hair\nloss). Nevertheless, there is no excess of fatal AEs, and the toxicity seems to be manageable with\nsupportive treatment such as anti-diarrhoeal medication, anti-emetic treatment and hematologic growth\nfactors.\nThe PK of SG has not been assessed in subjects with moderate or severe hepatic or renal\nimpairment. The risk arising from this lack of data is considered to be low in the case of renal\nimpairment and could be addressed by appropriate wording in the information for healthcare\nprofessionals.\nIn case of hepatic impairment, since there is a relevant risk that the exposure of SN-38 might be\nelevated, the use of SG in patents with moderate and severe hepatic impairment is not recommended.\nA study to determine a starting dose of SG in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, will be\nconducted as a PMR.\nThe immunogenicity of SG has not yet been characterised, because no validated assays with sufficient\ndrug tolerance and sensitivity have been developed so far. Analyses to characterise the immunogenicity\nof SG will be conducted as a PMR.\nPatients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer have an abysmal prognosis and limited\ntreatment options. SG has demonstrated efficacy in prolonging not only progression-free survival but\nalso overall survival in these heavily pre-treated patients. The OS benefit of 4.9 months in the ITT\npopulation is clinically meaningful. The toxicity is high but seems manageable with supportive\ntreatment, as in other oncologic diseases. Therefore, the risk-benefit is considered positive. While\npatients with brain metastases did not have a demonstrated benefit, they did not seem to suffer a\ndetriment and they have an important medical need.

        "summary": "Trodelvy is a cancer medicine containing the active substance sacituzumab govitecan and is administered as an infusion into a vein.\nTrodelvy is used to treat adults with a type of breast cancer known as metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC). This form of breast cancer is either so far advanced that it can no longer be removed or has already spread to other sites in the body (metastasised). The tumour cells also lack certain receptors. Receptors are very specific docking sites that exist for numerous substances. As soon as a specific substance binds to its receptor, it triggers a reaction in the cell. Triple-negative tumours have neither an oestrogen nor a progesterone receptor, nor do they possess an HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2). But these three receptors serve as possible sites of attack for other cancer medicines.\nBefore receiving treatment with Trodelvy, patients must have received at least two previous drug treatments for breast cancer that were not sufficiently effective.

Zu den ersten Symptomen solcher Reaktionen k\u00f6nnen Brustschmerzen geh\u00f6ren, die in Verbindung mit einer allergischen Reaktion auf Beta-Lactam-Antibiotika auftreten.\nPatienten mit einer \u00dcberempfindlichkeit gegen Carbapeneme, Penicilline oder andere Beta-Lactam-Antibiotika in der Vorgeschichte k\u00f6nnen ebenfalls \u00fcberempfindlich auf Meropenem/Vaborbactam reagieren. Vor Beginn der Therapie mit Vaborem sollte eine sorgf\u00e4ltige Pr\u00fcfung hinsichtlich fr\u00fcherer \u00dcberempfindlichkeitsreaktionen gegen Beta-Lactam-Antibiotika vorgenommen werden.\nSchwere kutane Arzneimittelreaktionen (SCAR) wie das Stevens-Johnson-Syndrom, toxische epidermale Nekrolyse, Arzneimittelexanthem mit Eosinophilie und systemischen Symptomen (DRESS), Erythema multiforme und akute generalisierte exanthemat\u00f6se Pustulosis (AGEP) wurden bei Patienten unter Behandlung mit Beta-Laktam-Antibiotika, einschliesslich Vaborem, berichtet (siehe auch \u00abUnerw\u00fcnschte Arzneimittelwirkungen\u00bb). Beim Auftreten solcher Reaktionen ist Vaborem unverz\u00fcglich abzusetzen und eine Alternativtherapie ist in Erw\u00e4gung zu ziehen.\nBei Auftreten einer schweren allergischen Reaktion muss die Behandlung mit Vaborem unverz\u00fcglich abgebrochen werden, und entsprechende Notfallmassnahmen m\u00fcssen eingeleitet werden.\nKrampfanf\u00e4lle\nW\u00e4hrend der Behandlung mit Meropenem wurden Krampfanf\u00e4lle berichtet (siehe \u00abUnerw\u00fcnschte Wirkungen\u00bb).\nPatienten mit bekannten Anfallsleiden sollten eine antikonvulsive Therapie fortsetzen. Patienten, die fokale Tremores, Myoklonien oder Krampfanf\u00e4lle entwickeln, sollten neurologisch untersucht werden und eine antikonvulsive Therapie erhalten, falls diese nicht bereits eingeleitet wurde. Falls erforderlich, sollte die Dosis von Meropenem/Vaborbactam abh\u00e4ngig von der Nierenfunktion angepasst werden (siehe \u00abDosierung/Anwendung\u00bb). Anderenfalls sollte Meropenem/Vaborbactam abgesetzt werden (siehe \u00abInteraktionen\u00bb).\n\u00dcberwachung der Leberfunktion\nWegen des Risikos einer Lebertoxizit\u00e4t (Leberfunktionsst\u00f6rung mit Cholestase und Zytolyse) sollte die Leberfunktion w\u00e4hrend der Behandlung mit Meropenem/Vaborbactam engmaschig \u00fcberwacht werden (siehe \u00abUnerw\u00fcnschte Wirkungen\u00bb).\nPatienten mit bestehenden Lebererkrankungen sollten die Leberfunktion w\u00e4hrend der Behandlung mit Meropenem/Vaborbactam \u00fcberwachen lassen. Eine Dosisanpassung ist nicht erforderlich (siehe \u00abDosierung/Anwendung\u00bb).\nTerminale Niereninsuffizienz (ESRD) oder schwere Nierenfunktionsst\u00f6rung\nEs ist zu erwarten, dass die Plasmakonzentrationen von Vaborbactam bei Patienten mit ESRD oder schwerer Nierenfunktionsst\u00f6rung in dem Bereich liegen, der in der tQT-Studie zu einer QTcF-Verl\u00e4ngerung gef\u00fchrt hat. Aus diesem Grund sollte Vaborem bei Patienten mit ESRD oder schwerer Nierenfunktionsst\u00f6rung mit bekannten Risikofaktoren f\u00fcr eine Verl\u00e4ngerung des QT-Intervalls und/oder mit gleichzeitiger Anwendung von Arzneimitteln, die bekanntermassen eine Verl\u00e4ngerung des QT-Intervalls zur Folge haben (siehe Eigenschaften/Wirkungen), mit Vorsicht angewendet werden.\nSerokonversion im Antiglobulintest (Coombs-Test)\nWie bei Meropenem kann w\u00e4hrend der Behandlung mit Meropenem/Vaborbactam ein direkter oder indirekter Coombs-Test positiv ausfallen (siehe \u00abUnerw\u00fcnschte Wirkungen\u00bb).\nClostridium difficile-assoziierte Diarrh\u00f6\nEs wurde bei Meropenem/Vaborbactam \u00fcber Clostridium difficile-assoziierte Diarrh\u00f6 berichtet. Der Schweregrad der Erkrankung kann von leichtem Durchfall bis zur t\u00f6dlichen Kolitis reichen. Die Erkrankung sollte daher bei Patienten mit Diarrh\u00f6 w\u00e4hrend oder nach der Anwendung von Vaborem in Betracht gezogen werden (siehe \u00abUnerw\u00fcnschte Wirkungen\u00bb). Ein Abbruch der Therapie mit Vaborem und die Anwendung einer spezifischen Behandlung f\u00fcr Clostridium difficile sollten in Betracht gezogen werden. Arzneimittel, die die Peristaltik hemmen, sollten nicht gegeben werden.\nAnwendung zusammen mit Valproins\u00e4ure/Natriumvalproat/Valpromid\nFallberichte in der Literatur haben gezeigt, dass die gleichzeitige Anwendung von Carbapenemen einschliesslich Meropenem an Patienten, die Valproins\u00e4ure oder Divalproex-Natrium erhalten, die Plasmaspiegel von Valproins\u00e4ure infolge der Wechselwirkung auf Konzentrationen unterhalb des therapeutischen Bereichs reduzieren kann, wodurch das Risiko des Auftretens von Anf\u00e4llen erh\u00f6ht wird. Wenn eine Anwendung von Vaborem notwendig ist, sollte eine zus\u00e4tzliche antikonvulsive Therapie in Betracht gezogen werden (siehe \u00abInteraktionen\u00bb).\nEinschr\u00e4nkung der klinischen Daten\nDie Anwendung von Vaborem zur Behandlung von Patienten mit komplizierten intraabdominellen Infektionen, einer nosokomial erworbenen Pneumonie einschliesslich einer Beatmungspneumonie, oder Bakteri\u00e4mie, die im Zusammenhang mit einer der indizierten Infektionen auftritt oder wenn ein entsprechender Zusammenhang vermutet wird, basiert auf Erfahrungen mit Meropenem als Monotherapie, pharmakokinetisch-pharmakodynamischen Analysen von Meropenem/Vaborbactam und auf begrenzten Daten aus einer randomisierten klinischen Studie, in der 32 Patienten mit Vaborem und 15 Patienten mit der besten verf\u00fcgbaren Therapie f\u00fcr Infektionen durch Carbapenem-resistente Organismen behandelt wurden (siehe \u00abEigenschaften/Wirkungen\u00bb).\nWirkspektrum von Meropenem/Vaborbactam\nMeropenem hat keine Wirkung auf Methicillin-resistente Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) und Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) oder Vancomycin-resistente Enterococci (VRE). Wenn erwiesen ist oder vermutet wird, dass diese Erreger zum Infektionsprozess beitragen, sollten alternative oder zus\u00e4tzliche antibakterielle Wirkstoffe angewendet werden.\nDas Inhibitionsspektrum von Vaborbactam umfasst Carbapenemasen der Klasse A (wie KPC) und Carbapenemasen der Klasse C. Vaborbactam inhibiert keine Klasse-D-Carbapenemasen wie OXA-48 oder Klasse-B-Metallo-Beta-Lactamasen wie NDM und VIM (siehe \u00abEigenschaften/Wirkungen\u00bb).\nNicht sensible Organismen\nDie Anwendung von Meropenem/Vaborbactam kann zu einer \u00dcberbesiedelung mit nicht sensiblen Organismen f\u00fchren, die eine Unterbrechung der Behandlung oder andere geeignete Massnahmen erfordern kann.\nNatrium-kontrollierte Di\u00e4t\nVaborem enth\u00e4lt 250 mg Natrium pro Durchstechflasche, entsprechend 12.5% der von der WHO f\u00fcr einen Erwachsenen empfohlenen maximalen t\u00e4glichen Natriumaufnahme mit der Nahrung von 2g.\nBei Umstellung der Therapie auf ein anderes Arzneimittel mit gleichem Wirkstoff ist Vorsicht geboten. Der Patient sollte ad\u00e4quat kontrolliert werden.\nInteraktionen\nIn-vitro-Daten deuten darauf hin, dass Vaborbactam und Meropenem CYP3A4 und CYP1A2 induzieren k\u00f6nnen. Bei einer gleichzeitigen Anwendung von Meropenem/Vaborbactam mit Arzneimitteln, die vorwiegend \u00fcber CYP3A4 und CYP1A2 metabolisiert werden, besteht das Risiko, dass eine m\u00f6gliche Wechselwirkung zu verminderten Plasmakonzentrationen des gleichzeitig angewendeten Arzneimittels f\u00fchren k\u00f6nnte.\nIn-vitro-Daten deuten darauf hin, dass Vaborbactam Pgp hemmen kann. Bei einer gleichzeitigen Anwendung von Meropenem/Vaborbactam mit Arzneimitteln, bei denen es sich um Pgp-Substrate handelt, besteht das Risiko, dass eine m\u00f6gliche Wechselwirkung zu einer erh\u00f6hten Plasmakonzentration des gleichzeitig angewendeten Arzneimittels f\u00fchren k\u00f6nnte.\nZwischen Meropenem und Vaborbactam wurden keine pharmakokinetischen Wechselwirkungen beobachtet.\nWirkung von Vaborem auf andere Arzneimittel\nDie gleichzeitige Anwendung von Meropenem und Valproins\u00e4ure war mit einer Verringerung der Valproins\u00e4urekonzentrationen und einem darauf folgenden Verlust der Anfallskontrolle verbunden.\nDaten aus in-vitro-Studien und tierexperimentellen Studien deuten darauf hin, dass Carbapeneme die Hydrolyse des Glucuronidmetaboliten der Valproins\u00e4ure (VPA g) zur\u00fcck zu Valproins\u00e4ure hemmen k\u00f6nnen und damit die Serumkonzentrationen von Valproins\u00e4ure verringern. Wenn eine gleichzeitige Anwendung von Valproins\u00e4ure und Meropenem/Vaborbactam nicht vermieden werden kann, sollte daher ein zus\u00e4tzliches antikonvulsives Mittel gegeben werden (siehe \u00abWarnhinweise und Vorsichtsmassnahmen\u00bb).\nOrale Antikoagulantien\nDie gleichzeitige Anwendung von Antibiotika mit Warfarin kann die gerinnungshemmende Wirkung verst\u00e4rken. Es gibt viele Berichte \u00fcber eine Verst\u00e4rkung der gerinnungshemmenden Wirkung oral angewendeter Antikoagulantien einschliesslich Warfarin bei Patienten, die gleichzeitig Antibiotika erhalten. Das Risiko kann mit der zugrunde liegenden Infektion, dem Alter und dem Allgemeinzustand des Patienten variieren. Der Einfluss des Antibiotikums auf den Anstieg des INR-Werts (international normalised ratio) ist daher schwierig zu bestimmen. Es wird empfohlen, den INR-Wert w\u00e4hrend und kurz nach der gemeinsamen Anwendung von Vaborem und einem oralen Antikoagulans h\u00e4ufig zu \u00fcberwachen.\nWirkung anderer Arzneimittel auf Vaborem\nSowohl Meropenem als auch Vaborbactam sind Substrate von OAT3; von daher konkurriert Probenecid mit Meropenem um die aktive tubul\u00e4re Sekretion und hemmt so die renale Ausscheidung von Meropenem. Derselbe Mechanismus k\u00f6nnte auch auf Vaborbactam zutreffen. Die gleichzeitige Anwendung von Probenecid und Vaborem wird nicht empfohlen, da dies zu erh\u00f6hten Plasmakonzentrationen von Meropenem und Vaborbactam f\u00fchren kann.\nSchwangerschaft, Stillzeit\nSchwangerschaft\nBisher liegen keine oder nur sehr begrenzte Erfahrungen (weniger als 300 Schwangerschaftsausg\u00e4nge) mit der Anwendung von Meropenem/Vaborbactam bei Schwangeren vor. Tierexperimentelle Studien ergaben keine Hinweise auf direkte oder indirekte gesundheitssch\u00e4dliche Wirkungen in Bezug auf eine Reproduktionstoxizit\u00e4t (siehe \u00abpr\u00e4klinische Daten\u00bb).\nVorsichtshalber sollte die Anwendung von Vaborem w\u00e4hrend der Schwangerschaft vermieden werden.\nStillzeit\nEs wurde berichtet, dass Meropenem in die Muttermilch ausgeschieden wird. Es ist nicht bekannt, ob Vaborbactam beim Menschen oder bei Tieren in die Muttermilch \u00fcbergeht. Da ein Risiko f\u00fcr das Neugeborene/Kind nicht ausgeschlossen werden kann, muss das Stillen vor Einleitung der Behandlung unterbrochen werden.\nFertilit\u00e4t\nDie Wirkung von Meropenem/Vaborbactam auf die menschliche Fertilit\u00e4t wurde nicht untersucht. Tierexperimentelle Studien mit Meropenem und Vaborbactam weisen nicht auf sch\u00e4dliche Auswirkungen auf die Fertilit\u00e4t hin (siehe \u00abpr\u00e4klinische Daten\u00bb).\nWirkung auf die Fahrt\u00fcchtigkeit und auf das Bedienen von Maschinen\nEs wurden keine entsprechenden Studien durchgef\u00fchrt. Insbesondere bei Patienten, die mit Antikonvulsiva behandelt wurden (siehe \u00abWarnhinweise und Vorsichtsmassnahmen\u00bb), wurden Krampfanf\u00e4lle w\u00e4hrend der Behandlung mit Meropenem als Monotherapie berichtet. Meropenem/Vaborbactam kann Kopfschmerz, Par\u00e4sthesie, Lethargie und Schwindelgef\u00fchl verursachen (siehe \u00abUnerw\u00fcnschte Wirkungen\u00bb). Daher ist beim F\u00fchren von Fahrzeugen und beim Bedienen von Maschinen Vorsicht geboten.\nUnerw\u00fcnschte Wirkungen\nZusammenfassung des Sicherheitsprofils\nDie bei den 322 Patienten aus den zusammengefassten Phase-3-Studien am h\u00e4ufigsten berichteten Nebenwirkungen waren Kopfschmerz (8,1%), Diarrh\u00f6 (4,7%), Phlebitis an der Infusionsstelle (2,2%) und \u00dcbelkeit (2,2%).\nSchwere Nebenwirkungen wurden bei zwei Patienten beobachtet (0,6 %): eine Reaktion im Zusammenhang mit einer Infusion und ein Fall erh\u00f6hter alkalischer Phosphatasewerte im Blut. Bei einem weiteren Patienten wurde eine schwerwiegende Nebenwirkung in Form einer Reaktion im Zusammenhang mit einer Infusion berichtet (0,3%).\nTabellarische Auflistung der Nebenwirkungen\nDie folgenden Nebenwirkungen wurden unter Meropenem als Monotherapie berichtet und/oder w\u00e4hrend der Phase-3-Studien mit Vaborem festgestellt.

        "full_text": "The evaluation of the efficacy data of this application was carried out in reliance on previous\nregulatory decisions by the EMA and FDA. The available assessment reports and respective product\ninformation from the EMA and FDA were used as a basis for the clinical evaluation.\nThe indication complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including acute pyelonephritis (AP) was\nsupported by study 505, a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, non-inferiority study evaluating\nefficacy, safety and tolerability of meropenem-vaborbactam compared to piperacillin/tazobactam in\nthe treatment of adults with cUTI or AP. For details, see the information for healthcare professionals\nand the assessment reports of the EMA and FDA.\nThe assessment focused on the requested indications complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI)\nand hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as well as\nthe treatment of infections caused by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria in patients with limited\ntreatment options. Efficacy in those indications was supported by study 506, a Phase 3, randomised,\nopen-label trial of meropenem-vaborbactam versus best available therapy (BAT) in the treatment of\ncUTI, cIAI, HABP/VABP and bacteraemia suspected or known to be caused by carbapenem-resistant\nEnterobacteriaceae (CRE). In this study, patients were randomised 2:1 to meropenem-vaborbactam\n(n=52) or BAT (n=25).\nThe baseline characteristics of the m-MITT population (microbiological modified intention to treat)\nwere largely comparable between the treatment groups. In both groups, 87% of the patients were\nwhite and 46% were female. The mean age was 63 years, and 49% and 26% of the patients were\nolder than 65 and 75 years, respectively, in the meropenem-vaborbactam group versus 42% older\nthan 65 years and 21% older than 75 years in the BAT group. The mean body mass index in both\ngroups was approximately 27.6 kg/m2. The majority of patients were enrolled in Europe and North\nAmerica.\nAt baseline, 37% in the meropenem-vaborbactam group and 47% in the BAT group had diabetes\nmellitus, 49% in the meropenem-vaborbactam group and 42% in the BAT group met the criteria for\nsystemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and 77% in the meropenem-vaborbactam group\nand 74% in the BAT group had a Charlson comorbidity index of \u22655. Most subjects (68% in the m-\nMITT population) in the BAT group received combination antibiotic therapy. The most frequently used\nantibiotics in combination antibiotic therapy were carbapenems (42% in the m-MITT population).\nThe primary efficacy endpoints were defined by indication (all-cause mortality for HAP, including VAP,\nand bacteraemia; eradication at test of cure (TOC)/overall success at end of treatment (EOT) for cIUI,\nincluding AP; and clinical cure at TOC for cIAI) and analysed for the microbiologically modified intention-\nto-treat population with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (mCRE-MITT) and the m-MITT\npopulation. Given the limited number of patients per indication, no statistical analysis was performed.\nAlthough this study was not designed for inferential testing, a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)\nrecommended early study termination due to evidence of benefit in the meropenem-vaborbactam\ngroup.\nOverview of Efficacy Results in Study 506\nThe overall results in all infection types combined can be considered indicative of a benefit of\nmeropenem-vaborbactam at the proposed dose in the treatment of infections caused by carbapenem-\nresistant Enterobacteriaceae. However, this study does not allow reliable conclusions to be drawn on\nefficacy, and thereby on the adequacy of the vaborbactam dose, in the separate infection types.\nAs meropenem is approved as monotherapy for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections and lower\nrespiratory tract infections, it can be assumed that appropriate concentrations of meropenem are\nreached for a sufficient duration at the infection sites. There is insufficient efficacy data to confirm this\nfor the proposed dose and prolonged duration compared to what is approved for meropenem\nmonotherapy. However, given that the new proposed dose with longer infusion time resulted in\nimproved attainment of the pharmacodynamic target, it can be assumed that the adjusted dose will\nnot negatively impact efficacy.\nFor vaborbactam, it is acknowledged that the preclinical data and PKPD analyses are supportive of\nefficacy of vaborbactam at the proposed dose. Based on similar properties of vaborbactam as\ncompared to meropenem, and similar drug properties in comparison to drugs known to penetrate well\ninto peritoneal fluid, it is expected that adequate concentrations of vaborbactam will be reached in the\nextracellular fluid and peritoneal fluid for the treatment of cIAI caused by CRE. Additional simulations\nto evaluate PKPD target attainment based on free-drug plasma PKPD targets and ELF exposures\nprovide further support for the use of meropenem-vaborbactam in the treatment of HAP/VAP.\nHowever, some uncertainties remain, as PKPD targets for ELF are not known and PK and penetration\nof meropenem and vaborbactam may be altered in patients with severe or critical HAP/VAP infection.\nAccording to the EMA Guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of\nbacterial infections, to support an indication of bacteraemia, comparable efficacy in patients with and\nwithout bacteraemia should be demonstrated. Few patients with bacteraemia at baseline receiving\nmeropenem-vaborbactam (n=12) were included in study 505. Furthermore, due to the design and\nlimited number of patients in study 506, no reliable conclusions can be drawn on efficacy in patients\nwith bacteraemia not associated with cUTI/AP, cIAI or HAP/VAP caused by CRE.\nOverall, based on all the available data and due to the lack of tissue-specific PKPD targets, it cannot\nbe assumed that adequate concentrations of vaborbactam will be reached at infection sites not\ndiscussed in this application. However, there is a clear need for treatment options for infections\ncaused by CRE. Furthermore, FDA and EMA guidelines acknowledge the difficulties in conducting\nadequate studies to evaluate efficacy and safety of antibiotics in the treatment of such infections. It is\nstressed that, in this case, the totality of the data should be taken into account, and support for a\nbenefit in the treatment of infections caused by multidrug resistance (MDR) will mainly rely on results\nof PKPD analyses. In view of these recommendations, and despite some remaining uncertainties, it is\nconsidered that the available data support the approval of Vaborem. The indication was adjusted to\nensure the appropriate use of Vaborem (i.e. in patients for whom the empirical treatment usually\nrecommended is not considered suitable). In addition, the limitations of the data were included in the\ninformation for healthcare professionals.",

        "full_text": "The prevalence of infections caused by carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemase-producing bacteria\nis increasing world-wide. These infections are associated with high morbidity, attributable mortality, an\nincreased duration of hospitalisation and higher healthcare costs (Magiorakos et al., 2017; Wong &\nvan Duin, 2017). As the treatment options for such infections are very limited, there is a need for\neffective treatments for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections.\nBeneficial effects\nIn vitro data and data from animal infection models demonstrated that vaborbactam preserved the\nactivity of meropenem against Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing\nEnterobacteriaceae.\nBoth meropenem and vaborbactam have similar, linear and time-independent pharmacokinetics in the\ntherapeutic dose range. No accumulation occurred after multiple TID dosing in subjects with normal\nrenal function. Both compounds penetrated into ELF. Vaborbactam was not metabolised but excreted\nunchanged in urine. There were no mutual pharmacokinetic interactions between the two compounds.\nNo dose adjustments for hepatic impairment were required. After accounting for renal function, no\ndose adjustments for age, weight, gender or race were required.\nMeropenem-vaborbactam showed high efficacy in the treatment of cUTI, including acute\npyelonephritis. Non-inferiority to piperacillin/tazobactam was demonstrated in a randomised, double-\nblind, double-dummy, non-inferiority study.\nFindings from a small Phase 3, randomised, open-label trial of meropenem-vaborbactam versus best\navailable therapy (BAT) suggested a benefit of meropenem-vaborbactam in the treatment of cUTI,\ncIAI, HABP/VABP and bacteraemia suspected or known to be caused by carbapenem-resistant\nEnterobacteriaceae (CRE). Although this study was not designed for inferential testing, a DSMB\nrecommended early study termination due to evidence of benefit in the meropenem-vaborbactam\ngroup.\nUncertainties regarding beneficial effects\nThe impact of hepatic impairment on vaborbactam PK was not formally studied. However, as\nvaborbactam is almost completely excreted unchanged in urine and has low plasma protein binding,\nhepatic impairment is unlikely to affect its pharmacokinetics.\nStudies 505 and 506 do not allow reliable conclusions on the efficacy and safety of meropenem-\nvaborbactam in the treatment of cUTI/AP, cIAI, HAP/VAP and bacteraemia caused by CRE due to the\nlimited number of patients with these infections included in the studies. Efficacy in these infections is\nassumed based on the efficacy of meropenem monotherapy and PKPD analyses.\nFew patients with bacteraemia at baseline were included in study 505, and the findings in study 506\ncan only be considered suggestive of efficacy of meropenem-vaborbactam in bacteraemia.\nEfficacy and safety of meropenem-vaborbactam in the treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram-\nnegative organisms in adults with limited treatment options other than those evaluated in the current application cannot be assumed due to the uncertainties related to PK and PKPD analyses and the\nlack of efficacy data.\nUnfavourable effects\nDose adjustments are required for renal function.\nMeropenem/vaborbactam caused a concentration-dependent QTc prolongation. The simulations of\nvaborbactam exposure in patients with different degrees of renal impairment after the proposed\ndosing regimen indicated that patients with ESRD or severe renal impairment may reach\nvaborbactam Cmax values that cause QTc prolongation despite the dose adjustments.\nThe safety profile of meropenem is already well-established. The most frequently observed AEs\nincluded headache, diarrhoea, infusion-site phlebitis and nausea. Regarding the safety profile of\nmeropenem-vaborbactam, no major differences to the comparator arms or to meropenem\nmonotherapy were observed.\nUncertainties regarding unfavourable effects\nThere remains some uncertainty regarding the safety profile of meropenem-vaborbactam, as the\nsafety database is not large enough to capture less frequent adverse events (AEs).\nConclusions\nThere were no major issues associated with meropenem/vaborbactam pharmacokinetics and\npharmacodynamics. The simulated dosing recommendations for patients with impaired renal function\nindicated a high probability of target attainment across all renal function groups, even for problematic\nbacteria like Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\nEfficacy and safety of meropenem-vaborbactam in the treatment of cUTI/AP, cIAI, HAP/VAP caused\nby CRE and bacteraemia associated with one of these infections can be assumed based on the\nefficacy and safety of meropenem monotherapy and the available preclinical, PK and PKPD data for\nmeropenem-vaborbactam. This was not fully confirmed by efficacy and safety data due to the limited\nnumber of patients with these infections included in the submitted studies.\nHowever, based on the totality of the data, and in view of the need for treatment options for patients\nwith infections caused by CRE and the difficulties of evaluating efficacy and safety in these relatively\nrare infections, Vaborem can be approved. The uncertainties regarding the data are included in the\ninformation for healthcare professionals.",
        "summary": "The number of infections caused by certain bacteria that are resistant to currently available antibiotics is increasing worldwide. Not only do these infections involve longer hospital stays and higher costs in healthcare, they are also associated with increased mortality. Since the options for treating such infections are very limited, there is a need for effective treatments for infections caused by resistant bacteria.\nIn the treatment of cUTI, cIAI, HAP/VAP caused by carbapenemase-producing enterobacteria or bacteraemia associated with one of these infections, Vaborem can be assumed to be effective and safe on the basis of the existing efficacy and safety data for meropenem therapy on its own and the available preclinical and pharmacokinetic data for the combination product Vaborem. In view of the limited number of patients with these infections participating in the studies, this could not be entirely confirmed by efficacy and safety data.\nTaking all the risks and precautions into account, and based on the available data, the benefits of Vaborem in treating the infections described above outweigh the risks.

Genes encoding \u03b2-\nlactamases may be present on the bacterial chromosome, and are also often found on mobile genetic\nelements such as plasmids and transposons, allowing for both horizontal and vertical genetic\ntransmission (Wong & van Duin, 2017). Of particular concern are carbapenemases, \u03b2-lactamases that\nhydrolyse carbapenems. This results in reduced susceptibility and resistance to carbapenems and\nother \u03b2-lactams.

All safety analyses were performed in all\nrandomised participants as treated (vaccination with PCV15 or PCV13 All participants as treated\n(APaT)).\nOverall, 7,438 participants \u226518 years received either PCV15 or PVC13. Of these, 5,630 subjects\nreceived PCV 15 and 1,808 subjects PCV13. The population was diverse with respect to age, gender,\nrace, ethnicity, and geographic region.\nThe median age was 62 years (range: 18 to 98 years) with approximately:\n\u2022 23% of subjects 18 to 49 years old\n\u2022 77% of subjects \u226550 years of age\n\u2022 45% of subjects \u226565 years of age\n\u2022 9% of subjects \u226575 years of age.\nOverall, 54.6% of participants were female.

None of the cardiac disorders (congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and coronary\nartery disease) were considered vaccine-related by the investigator.\nIn supportive Study 007 adults \u2265 65 years previously vaccinated with PPV23 received a single dose of\nV114 or PCV13\nThe proportions of participants with AEs, systemic AEs, and vaccine-related systemic AEs were\ngenerally comparable in both intervention groups. The proportion of participants with injection-site\nAEs was higher following vaccination with V114 compared with PCV13. The difference was generally\ndue to higher proportions of participants with solicited injection-site pain and injection-site swelling in\nthe V114 group. These differences were not considered clinically meaningful, as the majority of the\nAEs were transient and mild in intensity.\nNo participants in the V114 group experienced an SAE. Also, no participants died during the study.\nNo difference could be observed based on the time since the PPV23 vaccination (within or over 3\nyears).",

The clinical development programme of\nVaxneuvance (V114) was built on comparative immunology, which is acceptable.\nStudy V114-019 was considered the pivotal study that tested the non-inferiority of the common\nserotypes (STs) and superiority of the unique STs (and ST3) between V114 and a 13-valent\nconjugated pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13). All other studies were descriptive and not powered to\ndemonstrate differences in opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) and/or IgG responses across vaccination\ngroups, and thus are considered supportive for the application.\nSupportive studies investigated:\n\u2022 Lot-to-lot consistency and safety and immunogenicity of vaccine-na\u00efve, healthy adults \u2265 50\nyears (Study V114-020)\n\u2022 Safety and immunogenicity of PPV23 vaccination 1 year after V114 in healthy adults \u2265 50\nyears (Study V114-016)\n\u2022 Safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of V114 and PCV13 in adults \u2265 65 years\npreviously vaccinated with PPV23 (Study V114-007)\n\u2022 Safety and immunogenicity of V114 when administered concomitantly with influenza vaccine\nin healthy adults \u2265 50 years (Study V114-021)\n\u2022 Safety and immunogenicity of adults with risk factors for pneumococcal disease vaccinated\nwith V114 or PCV13 followed by PPV23 six months later (Study V114-017)\n\u2022 Safety and immunogenicity of adults \u226518 years of age with HIV infection (Study V114-018)\nStudy V114-019 was a randomised, active-controlled, parallel-group, modified double-blind study of\nV114 in adults 50 years of age or older conducted in 5 countries (USA, Canada, Japan, Spain, and\nTaiwan). This study was a modified double-blind study as the study personnel administering the\nvaccines were unblinded, while the participant and the investigator involved in the assessment\nremained blinded.\nOne Protocol Amendment was issued on 13 February 2020, 6 weeks before the study completion\ndate (30 March 2020). It added a secondary objective to demonstrate superiority for serotype 3 based\non the OPA geometric mean titres (GMTs) and the proportion of participants with a \u22654-fold rise from\npre-vaccination to 30 days post-vaccination. It also revised the statistical criterion for the evaluation of\nsuperiority for serotypes 22F and 33F to be >0.1 rather than >0 for the difference in proportions of\nparticipants with a \u22654-fold rise from pre-vaccination to 30 days post-vaccination for serotype-specific\nOPA responses (V114 - PCV13).\nEligible participants were healthy males or females \u226550 years without a history of invasive\npneumococcal disease or prior administration of any pneumococcal vaccine. According to the\ninclusion criteria, any underlying chronic condition(s) had to be stable according to the investigator\u2019s\njudgment. Subjects with a history of IPD or a known history of other culture-positive pneumococcal\ndisease within 3 years of Visit 1 were excluded. Other main exclusion criteria were: impairment of\nimmunological function, receipt of any pneumococcal vaccine or expected to receive any\npneumococcal vaccine during the study outside of the protocol, receipt of systemic corticosteroids\nexceeding physiologic replacement doses within 14 days before vaccination, and receipt of\nimmunosuppressive therapy.\nEligible participants were randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1 to a single dose of V114 or PCV 13. The\nvaccines were administered into the muscle.\nRandomisation was stratified by participant age (50 to 64 years, 65 to 74 years, and \u226575 years). At\nleast 800 participants \u2265 65 years of age were planned.\nA total of 1,205 participants were randomised across 30 study sites, of whom 98% completed the\nstudy. Major protocol deviations were reported in 29 participants (2.4%).\nDemographic characteristics were comparable for both groups. The median age of participants was\n66 years (range: 50 to 92 years), with approximately 69% of participants 65 years of age or older\n(n=830), and approximately 12% over 75 years of age.\nThe majority of participants were female (57%), white (68%), and of non-Hispanic or Latino ethnicity\n(78%).\nBaseline characteristics, medical history, prior medication, and concomitant medication were\ncomparable in both groups.\nThe primary immunogenicity analyses were conducted using the per-protocol (PP) population, which\nwas defined as all randomised participants without protocol deviations that could have substantially\nimpacted the results of the immunogenicity analyses. Supportive immunogenicity analyses were\nconducted for the primary immunogenicity endpoint using the full analysis set (FAS) population. This\napproach was acceptable.\nPrimary immunogenicity endpoints\nV114 met non-inferiority criteria for the 13 shared serotypes as assessed by serotype-specific OPA\nGMTs at 30 days post-vaccination with the lower bound of the 95% CI of the estimated OPA GMT\nratio (V114/PCV13) >0.5 for all shared serotypes.\nV114 met superiority criteria for the 2 unique serotypes as assessed by serotype-specific OPA GMTs\nat 30 days post-vaccination with the lower bound of the 95% CI of the estimated OPA GMT ratio\n(V114/PCV13) >2.0. Superiority criteria for the 2 unique serotypes were also met when assessed by\nthe proportions of participants with a \u22654-fold rise from pre-vaccination to 30 days post-vaccination for\nserotype-specific OPA responses. Also, the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the difference in\npercentages [V114-PCV13] was >10% for both unique serotypes.\nSecondary immunogenicity endpoints\nV114 met the superiority criterion for serotype 3 as assessed by the OPA GMTs at 30 days post-\nvaccination with the lower bound of the 95% CI of the OPA GMT ratio (V114/PCV13) >1.2.\nThe superiority criterion for serotype 3 was also met if assessed by the proportion of participants with\na \u22654-fold rise from pre-vaccination to 30 days post-vaccination for OPA responses. The lower bound\nof the 2-sided 95% CI of the difference in percentages [V114- PCV13] was >0%.\nNotably, the superiority criterion lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the OPA GMT ratio [V114/\nPCV13] >1.2 for ST3 is a rather low value and not scientifically established. The clinical relevance of\nthe superior immunogenicity for ST3 remains unclear.\nRelevant subgroup analysis:\nAge\nWithin the pre-defined age subgroups (50 to 64, 65 to 74, and \u2265 75 years of age) serotype-specific\nOPA GMT ratios at 30 days post-vaccination were consistent with the ratios observed for the overall\npopulation. However, there was a trend towards lower values in older patients (\u2265 65 years of age).\nImmunogenicity results were also analysed in all participants \u2265 65 years of age. In this analysis, V114\nmet non-inferiority criteria for the 13 shared serotypes and met superiority criteria for the 2 unique\nserotypes. The superiority criteria for the 2 unique serotypes were also met based on the proportions\nof participants with a \u22654-fold rise of serotype-specific OPA responses 30 days post-vaccination. Thus,\nthe findings are consistent with the overall results.\nHowever, OPA GMTs for ST4 and 19A after PCV15 vaccination were numerically lower compared to\nPCV13.\nTable 2 in the information for healthcare professionals presents the serotype-specific OPA GMTs at\n30 days post-vaccination for pneumococcal vaccine-na\u00efve subjects over 65 years of age.\nV114-020 (PNEU-TRUE) was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active comparator-\ncontrolled, lot-to-lot consistency study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V114\nin healthy pneumococcal vaccine-na\u00efve adults 50 years of age or older.\nEligible participants were randomly assigned in a 3:3:3:1 ratio to 1 of 4 intervention groups (3 different\nlots of V114 and PCV13.\nRandomisation was stratified by participant age at enrolment (50 to 64 years, 65 to 74 years, and\n\u226575 years). Similarly to Study 019, this was also a modified double-blind study as the study personnel\nadministering the vaccines were unblinded. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were mainly similar to\nthe pivotal study.\nA total of 2,340 participants were randomised across 55 study sites. Demographic characteristics\nwere generally comparable for vaccinated participants across intervention groups. The median age of\nparticipants was 65.0 years (range: 50 to 92 years). Approximately 55% of participants were\n\u226565 years of age, and approximately 10% of participants were \u226575 years of age. The majority of\nparticipants were female, white, and of non-Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.\nThe 3 lots of V114 met equivalence criteria, as assessed by the serotype-specific OPA GMTs for the\n15 serotypes in V114 at 30 days post-vaccination. For each pairwise lot-to-lot comparison, the lower\nand upper limits of the 95% CI of the GMT ratios were within the range of 0.5 to 2.0 for all 15\nserotypes in V114.\nInter-group comparisons of IgG GMCs at 30 days post-vaccination with V114 (Lot 1, Lot 2, Lot 3)\nwere consistent with the primary analysis of OPA GMTs.\nSerotype-specific IgG GMCs at 30 days post-vaccination were comparable in the V114 (combined\nlots) and PCV13 intervention groups for the 13 shared serotypes, and higher following administration\nof V114 compared with PCV13 for the 2 serotypes unique to V114.\nOPA and IgG antibody responses (geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) and proportions of participants\nwith a \u22654-fold rise from pre-vaccination to 30 days post-vaccination with V114 were generally\ncomparable across the 3 V114 lots for all 15 serotypes in V114.\nBased on the ST-specific IgG GMCs and OPA titres at day 30 the combined lots elicited in general a\ncomparable immune response to PCV13. Immune response seemed to be numerically lower for ST1\nand 4 (upper limit of the 2 sided CI not including 1) compared to PCV13, and seems to be numerically\nhigher for ST 3, 6B, 18C, 23 F and as expected for the unique STs 22F and 33F.\nStudy V114- 007 was a randomised, multi-site, double-blind descriptive Phase 2 clinical study\ncomparing the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a single dose of V114 and PCV13 in adults\n65 years of age or older in good health who had been vaccinated previously with PPV23 1 year or\nmore before study entry.\nA total of 253 subjects were randomised in this study (127 in the V114 group and 126 in the PCV13\ngroup). Randomisation was stratified by age (65 to 74 years of age versus \u226575 years of age) and time\nsince prior PPV23 vaccination (1 to 3 years versus >3 years). None of the 253 randomised and\nvaccinated subjects discontinued the study.\nThe demographics and baseline characteristics between the groups were balanced. The median age\nwas 72 years; 30% of the subjects were over 75 years of age.\nIgG and OPA responses were generally similar for shared serotypes in subjects administered V114\nas compared to PCV13 recipients. Similarly to previous studies, the OPA responses for ST4 and 5\nwere numerically lower for V114. In case of ST3, 18C a stronger OPA response could be observed for\nV114 compared to PCV13. In general, higher IgG and OPA antibody responses were observed in the\nolder age group with longer time since PPV23 and primarily in the V114 group.\nStudy V114-016 was a randomised, multicenter, double-blind descriptive Phase 3 active comparator-\ncontrolled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V114 followed by a\nPNEUMOVAX\u212223 one year later in healthy adults 50 years of age or older.\nA total of 652 participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either V114 or Prevnar 13\u2122 on\nDay 1 and PPV23 at Month 12. Randomization was stratified by age (50 to 64 years, 65 to 74 years,\nand 75 years or older. The majority of participants completed the study. Notably, participants could\nhave been considered as having completed the study without receipt of PPV23.\nDemographic characteristics were generally comparable for vaccinated participants across\nintervention groups. The median age of participants was 65 years (range: 50 to 90 years).\nApproximately 12% of participants were \u226575 years of age.\nSerotype-specific OPA GMTs at 30 days following vaccination with PPV23 (Month 13) were\ncomparable between participants administered V114 or PCV13 12 months prior to receipt of PPV23\nfor all 15 serotypes in V114. IgG GMCs were consistent with the primary analysis of the OPA GMTs.\nFor several STs the OPA GMTs at Month 13 were lower compared to 30 days following PCV\nvaccination (as in both vaccine groups for 6A, 6B) and similar for most STs.\nStudy V114-021(PNEU-FLU) was a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V114 when administered\nconcomitantly with influenza vaccine in healthy adults 50 years of age or older.\nSubjects with a history of IPD, prior PCV vaccination, prior PPV23 vaccination within 1 year, or with\nimmunosuppressed conditions were excluded.\nParticipants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either V114 with concomitant quadrivalent\ninfluenza vaccine (QIV) or V114 with non-concomitant QIV. Randomisation was stratified by age (50\nto 64 years, 65 to 74 years, and 75 years or older) and by history of prior PNEUMOVAX\u212223\nvaccination.\nOf the 1,200 randomised participants, 97.2% completed the study. Demographics and baseline\ncharacteristics including medical history/medications were generally comparable across intervention\ngroups. The median age was 65 years. Overall, 20.9% of participants reported prior administration of\nPPV23.\nPrimary immunogenicity analyses were conducted using the per-protocol population, which was\nassessed as acceptable.\nSerotype-specific OPA responses 30 days following vaccination with V114 were non-inferior in the\nconcomitant group compared with the non-concomitant group based on the analysis of GMT ratios\n(lower limit of 95% CI >0.50) for all STs. Although the pre-specified non-inferiority criteria were fulfilled\nfor all STs, the OPA GMTs in the concomitant group were lower for almost all STs (with the exception\nof ST19F). The clinical relevance of this observation is not clear.\nStrain-specific haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) GMTs at 30 days post-vaccination were non-inferior\nin the concomitant group compared with the non-concomitant group, as the HAI GMT ratios were\nabove the non-inferiority criteria of the lower limit of 95% CI >0.50.\nOne of the secondary endpoints also evaluated the proportions of participants with an HAI titre \u22651:40\nat 30 days post-vaccination with QIV. The rates of subjects with an HAI titre over 1:40 were similar\nbetween the groups.",

        "full_text": "Streptococcus pneumonia, or pneumococcus, causes community-acquired pneumonia, otitis media,\nsinusitis, and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), such as bacteraemia, sepsis, or meningitis.\nPneumococcal infections and IPDs are among the major causes of morbidity and mortality in Europe\nand globally, despite available antibiotic treatments. The disease burden is highest in infants/toddlers\nand in the elderly over 65 years of age. Apart from age, other factors such as immune deficiencies\n(e.g. HIV infection), chronic diseases, smoking, and alcohol abuse increase the risk of pneumococcal\ndisease.\nMore than 90 Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes are classified based on the polysaccharide\ncapsule. The distribution and prevalence of the serotypes (STs) differ across geographic areas and\nseasons.\nCurrently, 2 pneumococcal vaccines are available in Switzerland. A 13-valent conjugated\npneumococcal vaccine (PCV13) is approved for infants from 6 weeks to children 5 years of age for\nthe prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease, pneumonia, and otitis media. During the review\nprocess a variation for adults \u2265 65 years of age was also approved. The second available vaccine is\nthe polysaccharide vaccine containing 23 STs, which is approved for active immunisation against\npneumococcal disease for subjects over 2 years of age with risk factors.\nThis application concerns a 15-valent PCV including STs 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A,\n19F, 22F, 23F, and 33F. The two subtypes 22F and 33F are the additional STs in comparison to the\nalready authorised PCV13. However, these STs are included in the 23-valent polysaccharide\npneumococcal vaccine.\nHigher-valency PCVs might provide better coverage of the pneumococcal diseases compared with\nPCV13; however, the clinical benefit is highly dependent on the local epidemiological situation.\nWith an annual incidence of approximately 10 cases per 100,000 individuals for IPD alone,\npneumococcus remains an important cause of vaccine-preventable infections in Switzerland. The\nimpact of the infant immunisation programme has reduced most of the vaccine-type IPD cases in the\nvaccinated population. However, the rate of IPD in the elderly remained stable until the COVID-19\npandemic.\nThe most common STs responsible for IPD are ST8, ST3, ST23B, 22F, and 9N. Between 2013 and\n2021 ST22F was responsible for 5-11% of the analysed IPD cases. Between 2020 and 2021 this rate\nwas 7%. ST33F was found in fewer cases: around 2% between 2017 and 2021.\nThe clinical development of PCV15 is based on the comparable immunogenicity with PCV13. It aims\nto demonstrate non-inferiority of the immune response to 13 shared serotypes and superiority to 2\nunique serotypes. Clinical efficacy against pneumococcal disease in adults \u2265 65 years can be\nextrapolated from the CAPiTA study conducted with PCV13 (\u201cPCV13 was effective in preventing\nvaccine-type pneumococcal, bacteremic, and nonbacteremic community-acquired pneumonia and\nvaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease but not in preventing community-acquired pneumonia\nfrom any cause.\u201d2)\nThe proposed indication was \u201cfor active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease and\npneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults 18 years of age and older\u201d. The applicant\nrequested a marketing authorisation in accordance with Art. 13 TPA, with the EMA as the reference\nauthority. At the time of submission, the comparator product PCV13, was not approved for the\nproposed age indication in Switzerland, and the indications approved by EMA and FDA differ slightly.\nFor these reasons, a full clinical review took place.\nPivotal Study 019 enrolled healthy pneumococcal vaccine-na\u00efve adults 50 years of age and older with\nstable underlying conditions who did not have history of IPD and were not immunosuppressed.\nThe study met its primary endpoints. It demonstrated non-inferiority for the common STs and\nsuperiority for the 2 unique STs based on the OPA GMT ratios at Day 30 post-vaccination. The non-\ninferiority margin was not justified (the lower limit of the 95% CI for the GMT ratio >0.5). However, it is\ncommonly used in vaccine studies for regulatory approval and thus can be accepted.\nNotably, 7 of the common STs (1, 4, 5,7F, 9V, 14, 19A, 19F) in PCV15 elicited numerically lower OPA\nGMTs compared to PCV13. On the other hand, the immune response to ST3 was higher. Although\nST3 is one of the most common causes of breakthrough infection after PCV 13 vaccination, the\nclinical relevance of the higher OPA GMTs is not known.\nStudy 019 also provided evidence in participants 65 years of age and older. PCV15 met non-inferiority\ncriteria for the 13 shared serotypes and met superiority criteria for the 2 serotypes unique to PCV15,\n2 Bonten et al N Engl J Med 2015; 372:1114-1125\nas assessed by serotype-specific OPA GMT ratios at 30 days post-vaccination, consistent with results\nobserved in the overall population. This analysis was pre-specified in the country-specific study\namendment for Japan as requested by the Pharmaceuticals and Medicinal Devices Agency (PMDA).\nSupportive Study 020 evaluated lot consistency and immunogenicity (ST specific OPA GMTs and IgG\ngeometric mean concentration (GMCs)) of the 3 combined lots for PCV15 and PCV 13 in healthy\npneumococcal vaccine-na\u00efve adults 50 years of age or older. The study was descriptive, thus no\nstrong conclusion on the comparability can be drawn.\nStudy 016 showed a similar immune response in adults \u2265 50 years who were vaccinated with PPV23\n1 year after the initial vaccination with PCV15 or PCV13.\nAnother descriptive study (007) reported the immune response after previous vaccination with PPV23\nin healthy adults \u2265 65 years.\nIn Study 021 the co-administration of a quadrivalent split, inactivated influenza vaccine with PCV15 in\nadults over 50 years of age induced similar immunogenicity compared to non-concomitant\nvaccination.\nStudy 017 showed a similar immune response in adults 18 to 49 years of age with risk factors for\npneumococcal disease vaccinated with PCV15 and PCV13 followed by PPV3 6 months later.\nStudy 018 assessed the immunogenicity of PCV15 in pneumococcal vaccine-na\u00efve adults \u226518 years\nof age with HIV infection (CD4+ T-cell count \u226550 cells/\u03bcL).\nPivotal Study 019 in pneumococcal-na\u00efve healthy adults \u2265 50 years is the only study that tested the\nnon-inferiority for the common STs and superiority of the unique STs between V114 and PCV 13. All\nother studies were descriptive, and were not powered to investigate non-inferiority or superiority.\nComparable immunogenicity was therefore only demonstrated for adults \u2265 50 years.\nThe superiority analysis of ST3 as a secondary endpoint was added to the protocol late in the study,\njust 6 weeks before study completion. Furthermore, the superiority margin was low and not\nestablished in medical science (the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the OPA GMT ratio > 1.2).\nThe applicant explained that the superiority analysis of ST3 including chosen margin was added at\nthe request of the FDA. Taking the FDA request into consideration, inclusion of the superiority results\nin the information for healthcare professionals was accepted, provided the exact margins are\ndescribed.\nAlthough the above-detailed non-inferiority and superiority were met in the pre-specified sub-group\nanalysis in elderly subjects \u2265 65 years, there was a trend towards numerically lower serotype-specific\nOPA GMTs in older subjects (65 to 74 and \u226575 years of age) compared with the younger age group\n(50 to 64 years of age). The clinical implication of these findings is unknown.\nOverall, the immunogenicity data without an established correlate of protection are not sufficient to\nallow a conclusion on the protective clinical effect. Clinical efficacy can only be extrapolated for adults\n\u2265 65 years based on the results of the CAPiTA study, showing less VT IPD and VT after vaccination\nwith PCV13. As no clinical efficacy data are available for adults < 65 years, further justification was\nrequested to support indication below 65 years of age. The responses have not provided relevant\nadditional data confirming efficacy in these subjects, thus the indication has been restricted to adults\n\u2265 65 years.\nFurther limitations of the clinical development include a lack of data on the immune response in\nsubjects with non-stable medical conditions, immunosuppression, or immunodeficiency other than\nHIV.\nSeveral supportive studies provide descriptive results on the immune response in different age\ngroups, special populations, with sequential administration of PPV23, and with co-administration of\ninfluenza vaccine. These descriptive data suggest that PCV15 may induce a weaker immune\nresponse for ST4 compared to PCV13.\nImmune persistence data are limited to 1 study (Study 016). In this study OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs\nwere lower 12 months post-vaccination compared to 30 days post-vaccination, but higher than at\nbaseline and similar for PCV13 and PCV15 vaccines. There is a lack of longer-term immune\npersistence results.\nThe effect of co-administration was only evaluated for influenza vaccine (QIV). Although non-inferior\nimmunogenicity was shown, the OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs were lower for several STs in the co-\nvaccination group, which must be mentioned in the information for healthcare professionals.\nA total of 5,630 subjects received PCV 15 in the submitted studies. PCV15 consistently induced a\nhigher rate of solicited AEs, including injection-site and systemic reactions, compared to PCV13.\nReactogenicity decreased with age, as is usually seen with other vaccines. Importantly, the proportion\nof participants, who experienced SAEs was low and comparable in both vaccine groups. None of the\nSAEs were considered by the investigator to be vaccine-related. There were few deaths in either\nvaccine group; none were considered by the investigator to be vaccine-related.\nThe safety profile was consistent in special populations investigated in the supportive studies (HIV-\ninfected subjects, subjects 18-49 years of age, and subjects previously vaccinated with PPV23).\nSafety following subsequent PPV23 vaccination after a PCV15 dose (8 weeks in HIV-positive\nsubjects, 6 months in subjects 18-49 years old, and 1 year later in healthy adults 50 years of age or\nolder) was comparable to the safety observed for PCV13.\nSafety was not assessed in elderly subjects with risk factors, in subjects with unstable underlying\nmedical conditions, or in subjects with immunosuppression/severe immunodeficiency other than HIV.\nIn addition, very limited safety data were available for pregnant women, and no safety data were\navailable for breastfeeding women.\nThe data submitted demonstrated that PCV15 is immunogenic in the elderly population with stable\nunderlying disease. The non-inferior immunogenicity compared to PCV13 is considered proven for\nadults over 50 years of age. Thus, the clinical efficacy of PCV13 which is established for adults over\n65 years of age can also be expected with PCV15 for the same age group. However, no conclusion\non the additional STs (22F and 33F) can be drawn regarding clinical benefit. In addition, in the lack of\nefficacy data for the younger adults below 65 years of age no firm conclusion can be drawn regarding\nthe clinical benefit of Vaxneuvance in adults 50-65 years of age. For adults below 50 years of age no\nstatistically confirmed comparability to PCV13 could be demonstrated as the studies were descriptive,\nnot designed to test hypothesis. Furthermore, clinically proven efficacy/effectiveness data for this age\ngroup were not available. In the lack of an identified correlate of protection for pneumococcal disease\nin adults, the immunogenicity data do not directly support a clinical benefit.\nThe safety profile of PCV15 is acceptable, although the vaccine is more reactogenic compared to\nPCV13.\nIn conclusion, the data only result in a positive benefit-risk assessment for adults \u2265 65 years",
        "summary": "In all studies performed with Vaxneuvance that were submitted for the marketing authorisation, a total of 5,630 subjects received Vaxneuvance. The pivotal study with 1,205 subjects demonstrated a similar immune response to that after vaccination with PCV13. For adults over the age of 65, another study with PCV13 (CAPiTA study) showed that this immune response is associated with a prevention of the diseases. Therefore, in adults over the age of 65 after being vaccinated with Vaxneuvance, sufficient protection from diseases caused by pneumococci can also be assumed.\nNo clinical data of this kind are available for adults under the age of 65. Therefore, the indication was restricted accordingly in terms of age.\nTaking all the risks and precautions into account, and based on the available data, the benefits of Vaxneuvance outweigh the risks. Swissmedic has therefore authorised the medicinal product Vaxneuvance (a pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine, 15-valent, adsorbed) for use in Switzerland.",

        "full_text": "Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a common commensal bacterium and opportunistic\npathogen. Asymptomatic nasopharyngeal colonisation is common and ranges from 20 to 40% in\nchildren and from 5 to 10% in adults. While carriage is typically asymptomatic, pneumococcus can\ncause a variety of infections including otitis media, sinusitis, and pneumonia. Invasive pneumococcal\ndisease (IPD) occurs when pneumococcus enters normally sterile tissue sites, such as the\nbloodstream or cerebrospinal fluid, leading to septicaemia, meningitis, or bacteraemic pneumonia.\nOther, less frequent infections include periorbital cellulitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, pericarditis,\nperitonitis, pyogenic arthritis, soft tissue infections, and neonatal septicaemia.\nRates of IPD are highest in children under 2(-5) years old, adults over 65 years of age, and\n(especially) individuals with certain chronic health conditions including chronic pulmonary/heart/lung\ndisease, diabetes, splenic dysfunction, immunosuppression/immunodeficiencies, cerebrospinal fluid\nleak, Cochlear implant, smoking, or alcoholism. Crowded environments or poor socioeconomic\nconditions are also considered risk factors.\nIn Switzerland, approximately 80% of fatal pneumococcal infections occur in adults aged 65 years\nand older.1\nPneumococcal infections are treated with antibiotics and the choice of antibiotic should reflect local\nresistance patterns and national treatment guidelines.\nThe polysaccharide (PS) capsule of pneumococci is an important virulence factor, which protects the\norganism from phagocytes.\nOver 90 pneumococcal serotypes have been described based on the different capsule antigens. The\nprevalence and distribution of invasive serotypes differs across populations and geographic areas.\nPrevention of pneumococcal disease in adults includes vaccination with PCVs and PPVs and the\nprophylactic use of antibiotics in special populations. The mechanism of action of all licensed\npneumococcal vaccines is the induction of protective, serotype-specific, anticapsular antibodies.\nPneumococcal vaccines have demonstrated efficacy and effectiveness against invasive disease\ncaused by the serotypes contained in those vaccines in both children and adults. Recommendations\nfor pneumococcal vaccination in adults are typically based on age or risk for pneumococcal disease.\nChildhood immunisation against S. pneumoniae is the most effective public health measure for\npreventing IPD among both vaccine recipients (direct effect) and unvaccinated populations (indirect\n\u2018herd\u2019 effect) as children are the main reservoir, thus unvaccinated populations benefit from the\nreduction or even removal of the vaccine serotypes (VTs) in children.\nIn Switzerland, the Federal Commission for Vaccinations recommends pneumococcal vaccination for\nchildren under 5 and for older children and adults with health conditions with a high risk of an invasive\npneumococcal disease. Vaccination of healthy adults over 65 years of age was not recommended at\nthe time of this assessment.\nWith an annual incidence of approximately 10 cases per 100 000 individuals for IPD alone,\npneumococcus remains an important cause of vaccine-preventable infections in Switzerland.1\nIn Switzerland, the impact of the infant immunisation programme has reduced most of the vaccine-\ntype IPD cases in the vaccinated population; however, the rate of IPD in the elderly remained stable\n(until the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions were implemented.)\nThere is no immunological threshold level of antibody concentration that correlates with protection\nagainst pneumococcal disease in adults. Opsonophagocytic antibodies are surrogate markers for\nvaccine efficacy against pneumococcal disease and have been shown to correlate with vaccine-\ninduced protection. Due to the difficulties in conducting an efficacy study with the PCVs, an\nimmunobridging approach is acceptable to consider licensure.\n1 Zens KD, Baroutsou V, Fehr JS and Lang P (2022) Pneumococcal Vaccination Coverage and Uptake Among Adults in Switzerland: A\nNationwide Cross-Sectional Study of Vaccination Records.

        "summary": "Vaccines such as Vaxneuvance protect against infectious diseases by inducing the immune system to produce more antibodies or certain immune cells. The immune system recognises parts of the bacterium contained in Vaxneuvance as foreign and create antibodies against them. When exposed to the bacterium again, the immune system can then produce antibodies more quickly.\nVaxneuvance contains polysaccharides (special sugars) from the capsule of the pneumococcal bacterium (Streptococcus pneumoniae). There are more than 90 different types (serotypes) of this bacterium. Vaxneuvance uses the polysaccharides from 15 serotypes. To make these polysaccharides more easily recognisable for the immune system, and thereby elicit a good immune response, they are attached to (conjugated with) a protein from another bacterium.\nUnlike the pneumococcal vaccine Prevenar 13 (PCV13) already authorised in Switzerland and containing 13 serotypes, Vaxneuvance also uses an additional 2 serotypes (22F and 33F).",

The information for healthcare professionals includes\nwarnings and recommendations for monitoring in relation to potential transaminase elevations and\nrenal impairment. More detailed information on the safety profile and tolerability of remdesivir will\nbecome available when the final CSRs and a final safety analysis of all available safety data from the\nsubmitted studies will be provided (Zulassungsauflagen).\nThe main findings from the submitted studies were:\nCO-US-540-5776\nNon-serious Grade 3 or 4 AEs occurred at a similar frequency in the remdesivir arm (28.8%) as in the\nplacebo arm (33.0%). The most common adverse events in the remdesivir group were anaemia or\ndecreased haemoglobin (7.9%, placebo 9.0%); acute kidney injury, decreased estimated glomerular\nfiltration rate or creatinine clearance, or increased blood creatinine (7.4%, placebo 7.3%); pyrexia\n(5.0%, placebo 3.3%); hyperglycaemia or increased blood glucose level (4.1%, placebo 3.3%); and\nincreased aminotransferase levels including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, or\nboth (4.1%, placebo 5.9%).

All of these were slightly more common among\npatients in the placebo group. Four events (two in each group) were judged by site investigators to be\nrelated to remdesivir or placebo. No deaths were considered to be related to treatment assignment,\nas judged by the site investigators.\nGS-US-540-5773\nA slightly worse safety profile was seen with 10 days treatment as compared to 5 days treatment,\npotentially as a result of more severely ill patients being included in the 10 day-treatment group.

The mean age of the patients was 58.9 years, with 36.2% aged >65 years, and 64.3% were\nmale. Overall, 53.2% of the patients were white, 20.6% were black, and 12.6% were Asian. Median\ntime (IQR) from symptom onset to randomisation was 9 (6-12) days and comparable between\ntreatment arms. The majority of patients (88.7%) had severe disease. Somewhat more patients in the\nremdesivir group had comorbid conditions known to be risk factors for severe course of disease, most\nnotably coronary artery disease, chronic oxygen requirement, and chronic kidney disease. More\npatients in the placebo group had a score of 7 (hospitalised, receiving invasive mechanical ventilation\nor extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) on the ordinal scale, indicating more severe\ndisease and a higher risk of adverse outcome. At the time of the analysis, less than half of the\npatients in each treatment group received the planned full 10-day treatment course due to recovery,\ndeath, discontinuation, missed doses during treatment and the fact that about 20% of the patients\nwere still receiving treatment. The results may, therefore, not be fully representative of a 10-day\ntreatment duration.\nSuperiority of remdesivir over placebo was demonstrated for the primary and key secondary\nendpoints. Patients in the remdesivir group had a shorter time to recovery than patients in the placebo\ngroup (median, 11 days, as compared with 15 days; rate ratio for recovery 1.32 [1.12 to 1.55];\nP<0.001; 1059 patients). This primary endpoint was in line with the recommendations in the FDA\nguideline, although there is currently no single approved endpoint for the evaluation of efficacy in the\ntreatment of COVID-19. A more objective endpoint such as all-cause mortality would have been\npreferred to rule out any interference of potential problems regarding study conduct. The primary\nendpoint did not take into account durability of recovery.\nFor the primary endpoint, the effect was not consistent across disease severity strata; superiority over\nplacebo was only demonstrated in the stratum of severe disease. There was considerable variation in\ndisease severity in the group of patients categorised as having \u2018severe disease\u2019 (ranging from\nrequiring supplemental oxygen to mechanical ventilation, including ECMO). A statistically significant\nbenefit of remdesivir over placebo in the rate ratio for recovery was only seen in patients with a\nbaseline category 5 score (receiving oxygen). These results should, however, be interpreted with\ncaution, as the study was not powered for such subgroup analyses and no corrections for multiplicity\nwere made. No difference in mortality was observed between the remdesivir and placebo treatment\ngroup.\nTaken together, the results indicate a beneficial effect of remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19.\nThe findings suggest that a benefit may be restricted to patients requiring supplemental oxygen but\nwithout a need for high-flow oxygen, mechanical ventilation or ECMO, which is in line with the\nindication applied for.\nThe results from the ACTT-1 study were not confirmed in another double-blind, randomized, placebo-\ncontrolled trial conducted in China (CO-US-540-5758). This study was terminated before completion,\nbecause of decreasing incidence of COVID-19 in China during the study. No difference in mortality at\nday 28 was seen between remdesivir- and placebo-treatment, however no reliable conclusions can be\ndrawn due to the early termination of the study.\nStudies GS-US-540-5773 and GS-US-540-5774 were two randomised, open-label, multicentre\nstudies to evaluate the efficacy of two remdesivir regimens in participants with severe (GS-US-540-\n5773) or moderate (GS-US-540-5774) COVID-19 infection. In GS-US-540-5773, standard of care\ntherapy together with remdesivir at the dose applied for (single 200 mg IV loading dose on day 1, 100\nmg once-daily IV maintenance dose) for either 5 days or 10 days total treatment duration were\ncompared, while study GS-US-540-5774 compared standard of care (SOC) therapy with remdesivir\nfor 5 or 10 days with standard of care alone.\nThe study enrolled hospitalised patients 18 years of age, or aged \u226512 and <18 years of age weighing\n\u226540 kg with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and with radiographic infiltrates by imaging\nstudy. Furthermore, in GS-US-540-5773, patients with severe disease were enrolled: either SpO2\n\u226494% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen. In GS-US-540-5774, patients with moderate\ndisease were enrolled: SpO2 >94% on room air.\nThe primary endpoint in the studies was clinical status assessed by a 7-point ordinal scale on Day 14\nin GS-US-540-5773 and on Day 11 in GS-US-540-5774. The endpoint was not objective as\ndetermining the score on the ordinal scale partly involved investigators\u2019 individual assessment of\npatient\u2019s clinical status and may also be influenced by hospitals\u2019 procedures for the management and\ndischarge of these patients. Together with the open-label design this might have introduced bias and\nhad an influence on the study outcomes. For both studies, and in particular in patients with more\nsevere COVID-19, it can be questioned whether the time period over which the primary endpoint was\nevaluated was long enough.\nResults GS-US-540-5773\nThe mean age of patients was 60.0 (14.8) years (range 20-98 years), and 63.7% were male. Of note,\nalthough adolescents could be enrolled in the study, no participants <18 years of age were included.\nThe majority of participants was white (70.4%), black (11.2%) or Asian (11.5%). The treatment groups\nwere balanced in terms of demographic characteristics but not baseline disease characteristics.\nGreater proportions of patients in the 10-day group were in the two baseline ordinal scale categories\nindicating most severe disease as compared to the 5-day group. Median time (IQR) from symptom\nonset to start of treatment was 8 (5-11) days and 9 (6-12) days in the 5- and 10-day groups,\nrespectively.\nAfter adjustment for imbalances in baseline clinical status, patients receiving a 10-day course of\nremdesivir had a similar distribution across ordinal categories of clinical status, suggesting that there\nis no difference in the effect of 5- or 10-day treatment. Numerically, patients in the 10-day treatment\ngroup seemed to have worse outcomes as compared to patients in the 5-day treatment group. This\nwas consistent in the secondary endpoints. Because of the uncontrolled, open-label design, this study\nprovides no information on a treatment effect of remdesivir.\nResults GS-US-540-5774\nThe mean age of patients was 56.0 (15.1) years. Slightly more patients \u226575 years of age were\nincluded in the 10-day treatment group. One patient <18 years (12 years old) was included. Of the\nparticipants, 61.1% were male, and 61.3% of the patients were white, 18.5% were black, and 19.1%\nwere Asian. Median time (IQR) from symptom onset to start of treatment was 8 (5-11) days and\ncomparable across treatment groups. A slight imbalance in baseline disease characteristics was\nseen, as more patients in the SOC group required high- or low-flow oxygen.\nThere was a statistically significant difference in the distribution in clinical status at Day 11, indicating\na benefit of remdesivir in participants receiving a 5-day course of remdesivir compared with those\nreceiving SOC alone, while participants receiving a 10-day course of remdesivir had a similar\ndistribution as those receiving SOC alone. Numerically, the outcomes in the 10-day treatment group\nseemed to be worse than in the 5-day treatment group, as also seen in study GS-US-540-5774. The\nreasons for this finding are currently unclear. As only 37.8% in the 10-day group received a full course\nof treatment it is questionable whether the data from the 10-day treatment group are representative\nfor 10 days treatment duration. This further complicates the interpretation of the findings.",
        "summary": "The efficacy of Veklury was investigated in three different studies.\nThe largest study comprised 1,062 male and female hospitalised patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. Half of the study participants received a dummy drug (placebo). The other half of the participants received treatment with Veklury. This study showed that the benefit of Veklury was particularly evident in those patients who required supplemental oxygen. The time to recovery was shorter in the severely ill study participants who received Veklury than in those who received placebo. No difference in time to recovery was observed between the Veklury and placebo groups for those patients with mild COVID-19.\nAnother study with almost 400 male and female patients suffering from severe COVID-19 investigated the treatment period with Veklury. No significant difference in efficacy was observed between a treatment with Veklury over 5 days and a treatment with Veklury over 10 days.\nThe third study was conducted with almost 600 male and female patients with mild COVID-19. The participants in this study were investigated in respect of differing treatment periods with Veklury (5 and 10 days) compared to traditional types of treatment. The study investigated the improvement in health after 11 days. Those patients who were treated with Veklury for 5 days recovered sooner. The longer 10-day treatment period with Veklury did not produce any improvement in the time to recovery.",

        "full_text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 can range from mild to severe disease, with the\nmajority (approximately 80%) having mild to moderate disease, including flu-like symptoms up to mild\npneumonia. About 20% of infected patients develop severe to critical disease, with complications\nincluding acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), arrhythmia, septic shock, acute cardiac injury,\nacute coronary syndrome, cardiomyopathy, acute respiratory injury, and acute renal injury (see below\nfor main risk factors for severe disease). At the time of assessment, there were no approved drugs to\ntreat COVID-19 in Switzerland.\nThe pharmacokinetic profiles of remdesivir and its plasma metabolites GS-441524 and GS-704277,\nas well as the PBMC-associated, pharmacologically active metabolite GS-443902 following the\nproposed dosing regimen were characterised in four phase 1 studies.\nNo data on the PK in the target population are available to date. No clinical studies investigating the\nimpact of hepatic and renal impairment on the PK of remdesivir and its metabolites were conducted.\nThe impact of other factors such as race, age, gender or weight on the PK of remdesivir and its\nmetabolites was not evaluated in the context of clinical studies. Furthermore, no population PK\nanalysis was conducted to estimate the variability of the PK of remdesivir based on demographic\nfactors.\nThe dose applied for was selected based on efficacy data from studies in SARS-CoV-2- and MERS-\nCoV-infected rhesus monkeys and PK bridging from animal data to human doses. A potential effect\nfrom SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 on the PK of remdesivir was not taken into account, as no\nPK data in the target population are currently available. Based on the limited available information, it\ncannot be ruled out that another dose regimen might be more efficacious and/or result in a better\nsafety profile.\nThe optimal duration of therapy with remdesivir was not evaluated prior to the start of the clinical\nstudies. 5-day and 10-day treatment durations were compared in studies CO-US-540-5773 and CO-\nUS-540-5774. Results indicated possibly worse outcomes with 10-day treatment duration. The\nreasons for this are currently unclear. However, due to the subjective endpoint used and the open-\nlabel design, no reliable conclusions on the optimal treatment duration can be drawn from these\nstudies.\nSimulations based on the PBPK model suggest that the proposed dose results in similar remdesivir\nand GS-441524 steady-state exposures in adolescents compared to those in adults. However,\nconsidering the shortcomings of the model development and evaluation, this could not be reliably\nconcluded. Furthermore, it is currently unclear whether efficacy data from adults can be extrapolated\nto paediatric patients. As there were no PK or efficacy data available to confirm comparable\nexposures and/or efficacy in adolescents and adult COVID-19 patients at the proposed dose, no dose\nrecommendation for paediatric patients could be provided.\nRemdesivir treatment resulted in a 4-day reduction in time to recovery as compared to placebo\ntreatment in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 infection. Data on efficacy mainly resulted from one\nplacebo-controlled phase 3 study, in which patients received treatment for 10 days. The observed\nshorter time to recovery compared to placebo was mainly driven by the effect in patients with severe\ndisease, and more specifically by patients with baseline category 5 score (receiving oxygen). This\nsame pattern was observed for clinical status at day 15 and mortality at day 14. These results should,\nhowever, be interpreted with caution, as the study was not powered for such subgroup analyses (by\ndisease severity, baseline ordinal scale), and no corrections for multiplicity were made. The results\ncan, at this point be considered suggestive of a beneficial effect in the target population applied for,\nbut ideally would need confirmation from a second adequately designed and conducted randomised\ncontrolled trial.\nRemdesivir treatment was relatively well-tolerated as compared to placebo; Grade 3 and 4 adverse\nevents and (drug-related) serious adverse events occurred at a similar frequency. In addition, in\ncomparison to SOC, no relevant differences were observed.\nNo dedicated in vivo DDI studies were conducted. Overall, the DDI assessment was insufficient.\nThe absence of an unacceptable prolongation in cardiac repolarisation cannot be entirely excluded\nconsidering the lack of a tQT study and the shortcomings of the concentration-QT analysis.\nThe most frequently reported AEs in the RDV group in study CO-US-540-5776 were anaemia or\ndecreased haemoglobin (7.9%, placebo 9.0%); acute kidney injury, decreased estimated glomerular\nfiltration rate or creatinine clearance, or increased blood creatinine (7.4%, placebo 7.3%); pyrexia\n(5.0%, placebo 3.3%); hyperglycaemia or increased blood glucose level (4.1%, placebo 3.3%); and\nincreased aminotransferase levels including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, or\nboth (4.1%, placebo 5.9%).\nThe most frequently reported AEs in the RDV group in studies CO-US-540-5773 and -5774 were\nnausea, diarrhoea, headache, constipation, acute respiratory failure, ALT increased, acute kidney\ninjury, and hypokalaemia.\nAvailable preclinical data indicate a potential risk for renal toxicity. A similar risk in humans cannot be\nruled out.\nThe available data indicate no major safety issues, and adequate warnings are included in the\ninformation for healthcare professionals. More detailed information on the safety profile and tolerability\nof remdesivir will become available when the final CSRs and a final safety analysis of all available\nsafety data from the submitted studies will be provided.\nIn view of the unmet medical need for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, the\nZulassungsauflagen, and the proposed wording in the information for healthcare professionals, the\nclinical pharmacology package was considered acceptable. There remain uncertainties on the\nefficacy and safety of remdesivir treatment because, at this stage, mainly preliminary data are\navailable. Nevertheless, available data indicate a benefit of remdesivir and no major safety issues.\nIt is anticipated that the existing uncertainties can be resolved once more information will become\navailable from final analysis of ongoing studies. Therefore, and in view of the exceptional\ncircumstances due to the current pandemic with a clear unmet medical need, a temporary\nauthorisation in accordance with Art. 9a TPA was granted.\nIn the context of the temporary authorisation in accordance with Art. 9a TPA, several\nZulassungsauflagen were defined. In order to confirm currently available results, the final clinical\nstudy reports of studies CO-US-540-5776, GS-US-540-5773, and GS-US-540-5774 will be submitted.\nThe specific obligations defined by the EMA/CHMP (EMA/357513/2020) regarding these studies were\nfully endorsed, and it is anticipated that the final study reports and the responses to the specific\nobligations will address the existing uncertainties. Therefore, this information was requested to be\nsubmitted to Swissmedic as well. Furthermore, the applicant was asked to critically discuss final\nresults of the Solidarity trial in view of the final outcomes of their submitted studies.",

        "full_text": "Pivotal data regarding the efficacy and safety of the sGC stimulator vericiguat were provided by the\nVICTORIA trial, a large, multi-centre (694 sites), international (42 countries), randomised, 2-arm, PLB-\ncontrolled Phase III study in patients with symptomatic CHF. The VICTORIA study enrolled patients\n\u226518 years of age in the NYHA classes II to IV with an LVEF \u226445% and markedly increased NT-\nproBNP. Qualifying patients had to have a recent HF event (hospitalisation for HF [hHF] within the last\n6 months or intravenous diuretic treatment for HF without hospitalisation within the last 3 months). No\nrestriction to enter the study only after a particular pre-defined delay from the index event (i.e., the\nstudy partially enrolled patients during a hHF prior to discharge). Excluded were unstable patients\n(per protocol defined as administration of any intravenous treatment within the last 24 hours or\nsystolic blood pressure <100 mm Hg or symptomatic hypotension) and patients with interfering\ncardiac (e.g., hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, amyloidosis) and non-cardiac (e.g., kidney\nfailure, severe hepatic impairment, malignancy) comorbidities.\nAll patients received vericiguat or PLB in addition to the standard of care (see Table 2) each titrated\nfrom 2.5 to 5 mg to 10 mg based on systolic blood pressure. Table 1 illustrates the primary and key\nsecondary endpoints of the VICTORIA trial and the statistical methods used. The study was powered\nfor CV mortality, and confirmatory testing had to be terminated if CV mortality in the vericiguat group\nfailed to be superior to that in the PLB group. Table 1\nSource: SAP Table 1\nOverall, 5050 patients (3842 [76%] males and 1208 [24%] females) were randomised (1:1), of whom\nabout 77% completed the study. All patients randomised were included in the efficacy analysis. The\ndiscontinuation rate of 23% was accounted for almost completely by cases of death during the study\n(alternative reasons made up <1.5% in each treatment arm). The VICTORIA study assessed the vital\nstatus or the primary endpoint for 99.9% of the study participants (i.e. \u2264 0.1% missing data), which\nresulted in an amendment of the statistical analysis plan endorsing the omission of any sensitivity\nanalyses.\nPatient demographics (sex, age, representation of regions, race and ethnicity) and further important\nbaseline characteristics (e.g., NYHA class, qualifying event, renal function, NT-proBNP level, medical\ndisorders in addition to HF, and concomitant medication for HF and other comorbidities) appeared to\nbe well balanced between treatment arms. The study population had a mean age of 67 years and was\nmostly in NYHA class II (~59%) or III (~40%). The mean LVEF was ~29% (nearly 50% had a LVEF\n<30%). The mean eGFR at baseline was ~62 ml/min/1.73m2 (~10% had an eGFR \u226430\nml/min/1.73m2). The mean baseline NT-proBNP levels were 4803.7 pg/ml (vericiguat arm) and 4679.6\npg/ml (PLB arm).\nThe most common qualifying event (nearly 85% of all index events) was hHF typically within three\nmonths prior to randomisation (~66% of all index events). About 11% of these patients were\nrandomised while hospitalised (median time from admission to randomisation 8 days).\nMost frequent medical disorders in addition to HF were hypertension (79.1%), coronary artery disease\n(58.4%), hyperlipidaemia (57.3%), diabetes mellitus (46.9%), atrial fibrillation (45.0%), and prior\nmyocardial infarction (42.1%). The background pharmacotherapy for HF in both arms exemplified in\nTable 2 below was in accordance with the standard of care (SOC) at the time of study launch. Over\n90% of the patients in both arms received a combination of \u22652 HF medications. The proportion of\npatients treated with a combination of three classes (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, any\ninhibitor of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI),\nangiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI)], and beta-\nblocker) was ~60%.

During the entire course of the trial, >80% of the patients\nreached the target dose of 10 mg vericiguat, and ~62% stayed on this dose until the end of the\ntreatment period. Overall, the mean dose of vericiguat over the course of the study was 7.8 mg.\nVICTORIA met its primary endpoint (composite of CV death and hospitalisation for HF). There was a\nsignificant reduction in the number and rate (per 100 patient-years) of primary endpoint events\nconfirmed by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC) in the vericiguat arm as compared with the PLB\narm, equivalent to a modest 10% relative risk reduction (hazard ratio (HR) [95% CI]: 0.90 [0.82; 0.98];\np=0.019). The absolute risk reduction was 3% and 4.2 events per 100 patient-years.\nTaken from Ref. [7]\nThe treatment effect of vericiguat relative to PLB persisted throughout the study. It should be noted\nthat the relative short median treatment duration of just ~1 year resulted in an undesirably high\nnumber of censored patients (~25% and ~50% at 1 and 2 years, respectively) which may explain\npartial fading of the effect at later time points (failure to meet proportional hazard rule). KM-Plot for the primary\ncomposite endpoint\n(ITT Population)\nSource: CSR [Figure 11-1]\nBoth components of the primary endpoint contributed to this effect, but none of them showed a\nsignificant reduction in the vericiguat arm despite the fact that (i) the study was powered for CV\nmortality and (ii) the number of patients randomised substantially exceeded the sample size pre-\ndefined per protocol (cf. also secondary outcomes below).\nThe effect of vericiguat on the composite primary endpoint was consistent across most predefined\nsubgroups except for some apparent exceptions, most noticeably patients with very high NT-proBNP\nlevels and LVEF \u226540%.\nTaken from Ref. [7]\nThe point estimates for patients with baseline NT-proBNP \u22645314 pg/mL (quartiles 1, 2, and 3) were\nclearly in favour of vericiguat treatment as opposed to those with baseline NT-proBNP >5314 pg/mL\n(quartile 4), who did not share the benefit from vericiguat treatment (interaction test p-value 0.001). A\ncomprehensive post hoc analysis systematically covering the range of NT-proBNP and including\nmodelling of the HR as a continuous function of NT-proBNP further corroborated a potentially detrimental effect of vericiguat in patients with very high NT-proBNP at baseline [8]. Supplemental\npost hoc analyses further revealed that these patients were typically of older age, in higher NYHA\nclasses, and had a lower eGFR than patients who had lower baseline NT-proBNP. Importantly,\npatients with very high NT-proBNP at baseline clustered largely in the subcategory of patients\nrandomised during their index event, i.e. shortly after HF hospitalisation.\nAs one would expect from the above findings, patients who entered the study with a short delay after\nHF hospitalisation (within 1 months) showed no reduction in the composite primary endpoint (HR\n[95% CI] of 1.01 [0.88, 1.16]). Considering all the evidence discussed, one can assume that this\ngroup included a substantial proportion of patients who were not stabilised adequately. In contrast,\npatients entering the study with a longer delay from HF hospitalisation showed a reduction in the\ncomposite primary endpoint (HR [95% CI] of 0.79 [0.64, 0.97], 0.94 [0.71, 1.24], and 0.85 [0.67, 1.07]\nin patients enrolled within 1 - 2, 2 - 3, and 3 - 6 months from HF hospitalisation).\nThe results for the secondary outcomes were generally consistent with those for the primary endpoint.\nThe HRs [95% CI] for CV mortality and first hHF amounted to 0.93 [0.81; 1.06] (p=0.269) and 0.90\n[0.81; 1.00] (p=0.048), respectively.\nThe treatment with vericiguat resulted in a 9% relative risk reduction in the overall events (first and\nrecurrent) of hospitalisation for HF (compared with PLB (HR [95% CI]: 0.91 [0.84-0.99]; p=0.023).\nThere was a minor numerical reduction in all-cause mortality in patients treated with vericiguat (HRs [95% CI]: 0.95 [0.84-1.07]; p=0.377). Finally, the risk reduction for the exploratory endpoint of CV\nhospitalisation further supports a potential clinical benefit of vericiguat (HR [95% CI]: 0.88 [0.81-0.96]).\nTaken from Ref. [7]",

        "full_text": "Heart failure (HF) is a major concern in public health and associated with considerable morbidity and\nmortality. The 1-year and 5-year mortality rates in patients with chronic HF are ~7% and ~33%,\nrespectively, and acute decompensation of HF has become the leading cause of CV hospitalisations\nin people over 60 years of age. The prognosis gets even worse in patients who have had a\nhospitalisation for HFrEF (5-year mortality rate >75%). The recent addition of SGLT2 inhibitors (e.g.,\ndapagliflozin) to SOC has improved the treatment of patients with HFrEF. Nevertheless, there is a\nmedical need for further treatment options, preferably for those affecting the pathogenesis of HF in a\nmanner different from the currently available treatments.\nBeneficial effects\nThe pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of vericiguat have been thoroughly studied\nin healthy subjects as well as in the intended patient population. Vericiguat has a low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. No dose adjustments in subjects with impaired renal (mild to\nsevere) or hepatic function (mild and moderate), or based on demographic factors are required.\nVericiguat reduced (relative risk reduction: 10%) the composite primary endpoint consisting of CV\ndeath and hospitalisation for HF (time to 1st event). The hazard ratio (HR[95% CI]) of the vericiguat\ngroup versus placebo control was 0.90 [0.82; 0.98] (p=0.019). The absolute risk reduction in the\nprimary endpoint was 4.2 events per 100 patient-years. This effect was primarily driven by the\nreduction of HF hospitalisation events (hHF). The HRs [95% CI] for the two components of the\nprimary endpoint were 0.93 [0.81; 1.06] (CV mortality; p=0.269) and 0.90 [0.81; 1.00] (hHF; p=0.048).\nVericiguat also reduced the total HF hospitalisations (first and recurrent events) compared with\nplacebo (HR [95% CI]: 0.91 [0.84-0.99]; p=0.023). There was a minor numerical reduction in all-cause\nmortality (HRs [95% CI]: 0.95 [0.84; 1.07]; p=0.377). Finally, there was a risk reduction for the\nexploratory endpoint CV hospitalisation in vericiguat-treated patients (HR [95% CI]: 0.88 [0.81-0.96]).\nThere is heterogeneity of the treatment benefit depending on baseline NT-proBNP and LVEF with\nimplications for the definition of the target population.\nUncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects\nLack of data in subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or severe hepatic impairment limits the\nuse of vericiguat in these patients. The risk of effects on the QT interval at supratherapeutic\nexposures is unclear due to lack of data. It remains unclear whether vericiguat doses higher than\n10 mg could have yielded more favourable efficacy outcomes.\nThe effect on the primary endpoint was observed for a mean treatment duration of just ~1 year. None\nof the individual components of the primary endpoint showed a statistically significant reduction in the\nvericiguat group of VICTORIA powered for CV mortality.\nCurrently, the additivity of the clinical benefits of vericiguat and SGLT2 inhibitors for patients with\nHFrEF remains unclear.\nUnfavourable effects (risks)\nVericiguat belongs to the relatively new therapeutic group of sGC stimulators. Therefore, knowledge\non its safety profile is still limited. Although its safety profile might be expected to be in line with other\nsGC stimulating agents, the interaction with other therapies used in a CHF population with reduced\nejection fraction and the disease characteristics may complicate the interpretation of the safety profile.\nConclusion\nIn summary, vericiguat treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the primary endpoint\nas compared with placebo control. The robustness of this effect in the overall study population of the\nVICTORIA trial is uncertain (e.g. lack of efficacy in patients with very high NT-proBNP levels and\nLVEF \u226540%). This has been addressed in the revised indication restricted to patients who have been\nstabilised after a HF decompensation event (with the aim of excluding patients with very high NT-\nproBNP levels from treatment) and to patients with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF <40%).\nVarious safety concerns are related to sGC stimulators such as vericiguat, primarily hypotension,\nepisodes of syncope, and anaemia. None of these concerns is considered prohibitive for an approval\nof vericiguat in the revised indication.\nTaken together, the benefit-risk ratio for vericiguat in the target population defined by the adapted\nindication (i.e., patients stabilised adequately after a prior HF decompensation event) can be\nconsidered positive.",

Most of these patients\nsuffer from left ventricular dysfunction, which can be divided into two major forms based primarily on\nthe reduction of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) [2, 3]: HF with reduced ejection fraction\n(HFrEF: LVEF <40%) and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF: LVEF \u226550%).\nHFrEF is a progressive medical disorder associated with high morbidity and mortality (5-year mortality\nrate following hospitalisation for HFrEF exceeds 75% [4]). Thus, there is a medical need for novel\ntherapy options in addition to the current standard of care.\nA relative cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) deficit due to dysfunctional nitric oxide (NO)-\ncGMP signalling is thought to play a role in the development and progression of CHF (for review see\n[5, 6]). However, none of the current standard treatments for CHF (renin-angiotensin inhibitors, beta-\nblockers, and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists) tackles this pathophysiological mechanism.\nClosing this gap (i.e., promoting restoration of physiological cGMP levels), stimulators of soluble\nguanylyl cyclase (sGC) represent a novel drug development expected to improve left ventricular\nfunction in patients with HFrEF.",

Considering all\naspects of the medical history and the course of the event, the latter case seems unlikely to be\nrelated.\nSAEs (Q4W vs oral SOC)\nSerious adverse events (SAEs) occurred more frequently under the Q4W CAB+RPV treatment\nregimen than under oral SOC through to Week 48 in the FLAIR and ATLAS pool: 10% vs 9%,\nrespectively.\nThis difference through to Week 48 was mainly driven by treatment-naive patients (FLAIR study: 6%\nvs 4% of patients, ATLAS study: 4% vs 5% of patients), but through to Week 100, this difference in\ntreatment-naive FLAIR patients had levelled out (8% vs 8%, Q4W vs SOC).\nDue to the different durations of controlled phases of the FLAIR and ATLAS studies, no Week 100\ncomparison is available for treatment-experienced ATLAS patients.\nThe higher risk for treatment-naive patients in the first year of treatment may be regarded as\nacceptable as no higher risk of fatal SAEs was observed.\nSAEs (Q8W vs Q4W)\nMore SAEs occurred under the Q8W vs the Q4W treatment regimen in the ATLAS-2M study: 5% vs.\n4% of patients, respectively.\nSAEs (Q8W vs oral SOC)\nA post-hoc indirect comparison of the Q8W and QD oral SOC regimens showed that the risk lf SAEs\nis higher for the Q8W treatment regimen than for oral SOC (odds ratio 1.8) (excluding injection site\nreactions). However, the differences between the treatment groups are considered small enough to\nbe acceptable for approval.\nGrade 3-4 AEs (Q4W vs oral SOC):\nMore grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) were observed through to Week 48 in the investigational\ntreatment group than in the control group: 11% versus 6% patients of the pooled FLAIR and ATLAS\nstudies, respectively.\nThrough to Week 100, 14% vs 6% patients of the FLAIR study suffered 3-4 AEs.\nGrade 3-4 AEs (Q8W vs Q4W):\nSimilar proportions of patients in the two long-acting injection treatment groups experienced grade 3-4\nAEs when excluding injections site reactions (4.9% vs 4.6% patients, respectively).\nAEs (Q4W vs oral SOC)\nOverall, the frequency of AEs was distinctly higher in the Q4W CAB+RPV groups than in the control\ngroups on standard oral ART in both pivotal Phase 3 studies, FLAIR (94% vs 80%) and ATLAS (95%\nvs 71%). The picture remained similar after exclusion of the high rates of injection site reactions and\nwas principally consistent over all categories of AEs, including adverse drug reactions. See also Table\n6 in Adverse Reactions section of the Swiss information for healthcare professionals.\nAEs (Q8W vs Q4W)\nSlightly fewer subjects from the Q8W than from the Q4W treatment group suffered non-serious AEs\nincluding injection site reactions in the ATLAS-2M study (91% vs 92%). However, this is more than\nwith oral SOC (see below) and is probably due to the less frequent injection site reactions (ISRs). An\nanalysis of AEs excluding ISRs was not provided.\nAEs (Q8W vs oral SOC)\nAcross the studies, the slightly lower AE frequency (including ISRs) under the Q8W versus the Q4W\ntreatment regimen is still much higher when compared with the oral SOC arms in the FLAIR and\nATLAS studies (91% vs 71-80%, see above).A post-hoc anchored indirect comparison of the Q8W treatment regimen with QD oral SOC, which\nused the Q4W treatment regimen as the common comparator, showed that \u2013 even when excluding\nISRs - the risk of AEs, grade 3-5 AEs and discontinuations due to AEs is higher for the Q8W\ntreatment regimen than for QD oral SOC ART regimens (odds ratios 1.2, 1.7 and 1.5, respectively).\nGreater use of pain killers was observed in patients on the long-acting injection treatment regimens\ncompared to oral SOC.\nThe adverse drug reactions of the Q4W and Q8W treatment regimens with CAB+RPV (including oral\nlead-in or bridging phases) are listed and described in the Warnings and Precautions section of the\nSwiss information for healthcare professionals.",

        "full_text": "Beneficial effects\nPK Vocabria (oral and IM):\nThe PK characteristics of cabotegravir are adequately characterised; the prolongation of the terminal\nhalf-life following IM administration is well understood. Therapeutically targeted cabotegravir plasma\nconcentrations are maintained during all phases of treatment following the Q4W or the Q8W dosing\nregimen.The PK of cabotegravir was assessed in patients with mild and moderate (Child Pugh A and\nB) hepatic impairment and in patients with mild, moderate and severe (not requiring dialysis) renal\nimpairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment or with severe renal impairment requiring\ndialysis were not investigated. The interaction potential was comprehensively assessed and results of\nthese assessments and respective dosing recommendations are included in the information for\nhealthcare professionals.There was no QT/QTc prolongation potential for cabotegravir at\nsupratherapeutic cabotegravir oral doses.\nQ4W treatment regimen\nEfficacy of the Q4W CAB+RPV treatment regimen was demonstrated in two pivotal Phase 3 studies,\nFLAIR and ATLAS, in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients who were\nvirologically suppressed for 5-6 months prior to start of treatment with CAB+RPV. Non-inferiority to\noral standard of care (DTG/ABC/3TC in the FLAIR study; a dual NRTI backbone plus INI, NNRTI or PI\nas a third drug in the ATLAS study) was shown with respect to loss of virologic suppression, the\nparameter of interest in switch trials.\nQ8W treatment regimen\nEfficacy of the Q8W CAB+RPV treatment regimen was demonstrated in the pivotal Phase 3b ATLAS-\n2M study in HIV-1-infected patients who were virologically suppressed prior to study start for at least 6\nmonths (either by Q4W CAB+RPV LAI or by oral SOC). Non-inferiority to the Q4W CAB+RPV\ntreatment regimen was shown with respect to loss of virologic suppression, the parameter of interest\nin switch trials.\nUncertainties about the beneficial effects\nAlthough Vocabria/Rekambys is a long-term treatment, no pivotal data on efficacy, development of\nHIV resistances and safety are available beyond 2 years.\nUnfavourable effects (risks)\nPK: The combined administration of cabotegravir with UGT1A1 inducers such as rifampicin is\ncontraindicated due to the 59% decrease in cabotegravir AUC and loss of antiviral activitiy. Long persisting drug release after IM injection (Q4W and Q8W)\nThe long persistence of the drug release is especially relevant after end of treatment with\nVocabria/Rekambys. There is neither a mechanism by which the drug release from the IM depots can\nbe stopped, nor a mechanism by which the IM depots can be removed or accessed by aspiration.\nFurthermore, once the drugs have reached the systemic circulation, there are no known neutralising\ndrugs or antibodies, and even if there were a short-term mechanism to reduce systemic\nconcentrations, these would be subsequently replaced by drug released from the IM depots. Lastly,\nboth CAB and RPV are heavily protein bound molecules and are not expected to be susceptible to\nremoval via hemodialysis. See also the Warnings and Precautions section of the Swiss information for\nhealthcare professionals.\nIn conclusion, the single death cases, the slightly higher risk of SAEs, the higher frequencies of non-\nserious AEs under the Q4W and Q8W treatment regimens with cabotegravir and rilpivirine in\ncomparison to the daily oral standard of care and any individual (S)AEs were not considered as\nprohibitive for approval.\nConclusion\n1. Q4W treatment regimen\nVocabria & Rekambys, a complete treatment regimen combining only the two antiretrovirals\ncabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV), is a new treatment option with a new route of administration\n(intramuscular long-acting injections, IM LAI) and a reduced dosing frequency (monthly, Q4W). In\nterms of efficacy, this treatment regimen has been proven to be non-inferior to standard oral\nantiretroviral regimens (SOC) in treatment-naive HIV-1-infected patients after a 5 month induction of\nvirologic suppression with SOC as well as in treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients who were\nvirologically suppressed for at least 6 months and had no history of virologic failure.\nIn terms of safety, the Q4W CAB+RPV IM LAI regimen appears to be associated with more\nrisks than oral SOC regimens because of a) the long persistence of drug release after IM injection, b)\na slightly higher frequency of SAEs (at least for treatment-naive patients in the first treatment year), c)\na distinctly higher frequency of grade 3-4 AEs and of AEs in general (with and without injection site\nreactions) and d) more frequent use of analgetics due to the very common ISRs.\nAll these above-mentioned uncertainties and risks can be regarded as acceptable as a) there\nwas no higher risk of fatal SAEs compared to oral SOC, b) the patients are free to switch back to oral\nSOC and c) all relevant information is provided in the Swiss information for healthcare professionals\nand patient information.\nIn summary, the benefit-risk ratio for the Q4W CAB+RPV IM LAI regimen is positive.\n2. Q8W treatment regimen\nVocabria & Rekambys, a complete treatment regimen combining only the two antiretrovirals\ncabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV), is a new treatment option with a new route of administration\n(intramuscular long-acting injections, IM LAI) and a reduced dosing frequency (monthly, Q4W).\nIn terms of efficacy, this treatment regimen has been proven non-inferior to the Q4W treatment\nregimen (with a very small numerical disadvantage) in HIV-1-infected patients who were virologically\nsuppressed for at least 6 months.\nThe Q8W treatment regimen was, however, not directly compared to standard oral\nantiretroviral regimens (SOC), which is considered acceptable based on the totality of the data. A\ncross-study comparison of the Q8W treatment regimen with oral SOC suggests a virologic failure rate in the same order of magnitude. A post-hoc indirect comparison with oral SOC, which used the Q4W\ntreatment regimen as the common comparator, revealed only slightly more treatment failures in the\nQ8W treatment regimen, which is acceptable because a switch back to one of numerous oral\nantiretroviral regimens is possible.\nIn terms of safety, the Q8W CAB+RPV IM LAI regimen appears to be associated with more\nrisks than oral SOC regimens because of a) the long persistence of drug release after IM injection,\nand b) a higher risk of SAEs, grade 3-5 AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation and AEs in general (with\nand without ISRs) \u2013 as suggested by a post-hoc indirect comparison between the Q8W treatment\nregimen and oral SOC.\nWhen comparing the Q8W with the Q4W treatment regimen, the Q8W regimen seems to be\nassociated with a slightly higher risk of SAEs and injection site reactions (ISRs). However, there was\nno difference in the frequency of grade 3 AEs, and a slightly lower frequency of grade 3 ISRs, slightly\nlower use of analgesics and a slightly lower frequency of non-serious AEs (including ISR). As the\nsafety differences between the two long-acting injection regimens were rather small (mostly 1% of\npatients), the two treatment regimens are considered interchangeable.\nIn summary, the benefit-risk ratio for the Q8W CAB+RPV IM LAI regimen is positive.",

Patients were\nrandomised (in a 1:1:1:1 ratio) to one of three dose levels of eptinezumab (30 mg, 100 mg and 300\nmg) or placebo. Randomisation was stratified by migraine days during screening (\u2264 9 days or > 9\ndays).\nThe total study duration was 60 weeks with 12 scheduled visits. There was a baseline period of 4\nweeks to determine eligibility, followed by treatment with eptinezumab/placebo on day 0, 84 (week\n12), 168 (week 24) and 252 (week 36), and a follow-up period of 20 weeks following the final dose. All\nfour of the scheduled infusions were given 12 weeks apart, and patients kept an eDiary for recording\nsymptoms and migraines in between infusions through week 48. Patients were allowed to use acute\nmigraine treatment as concomitant medication, but no prophylactic treatment. The primary endpoint\nwas the reduction in monthly migraine days (MMD) vs. baseline vs. placebo during the first 12 weeks,\nbased on eDiary entries by patients.\nIn study 006, at least one treatment was received by n = 224 patients in the 30 mg group, 225\npatients in the 100 mg group, 224 in the 300 mg group and 225 patients in the placebo group. The\nstudy was performed mainly in the US, accounting for 84.4% of the study population, and the\nremaining 15.6% were recruited in the Republic of Georgia. About 84% of the participants were white,\n12% were black and the rest belonged to other races. The mean age was about 40 years, the mean\ntime since migraine diagnosis was 17 years, around 84% were women, the number of mean monthly\nmigraine days (MMD) at baseline was 8.6 days, the number of monthly headache days was 10, the\nnumber of monthly migraine attacks was 6.4. Around 33% of patients had migraine with aura at\nbaseline. Discontinuation rates were about 13-17%, with a discontinuation rate due to adverse events\nof only 1%. Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment\ngroups. The compliance with eDiary entries was around 85-90% during the double-blind treatment\nphase without relevant differences between treatment groups. The included population can be\nregarded as adequate for the requested indication, and comparable overall to the populations in\nepisodic migraine studies of the other already approved CGRP antibodies. The design of the study\ncan also be regarded as adequate. Efficacy results in episodic migraine:\nIn the primary endpoint analyses, statistically significant differences vs. placebo were reached for\neptinezumab 300 mg (-1.1 MMD) and eptinezumab 100 mg (-0.69 MMD). The primary endpoint for\nthe eptinezumab 30 mg arm was nominally significant (treatment difference -0.82 MMD) but,\naccording to the statistical decision rule, the 30 mg treatment arm was not statistically significant.\nEffects for several secondary endpoints such as 50%, 75% and 100% responder differences and\nacute migraine medication days showed moderate and partly statistically significant differences vs.\nplacebo. Some other secondary endpoints like \u201cpercent patients with severe intensity of migraine or\nmigraine hours per 4 weeks\u201d showed larger differences in favour of active treatments. Subgroup\nanalyses for age, sex and race did not show relevant differences. Sensitivity analyses (excluding\npossibly unblinded patients, other analyses using different imputation methods for missing data)\nsupported the primary analyses without relevant differences in the outcomes.\nChronic migraine\nStudy 011 was a parallel-group, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, and patients were\nrandomised to one of two dose levels of eptinezumab (100 mg or 300 mg) or placebo. Patients were\nrandomised in a 1:1:1 ratio, and randomisation was stratified by baseline migraine days during\nscreening (< 17 or \u2265 17 days), as well as prophylactic medication use during the 3 months prior to\nscreening.\nThe total study duration was 36 weeks with 10 scheduled visits. There was a baseline period of 4\nweeks to determine eligibility, followed by treatments on day 0 and day 84 (week 12), and a follow-up\nvisit 20 weeks after the final dose (week 32). The scheduled infusions were given 12 weeks apart.\nProphylactic headache medications were permitted, assuming that the dose had been stable for at\nleast 3 months with no changes allowed through week 24. Endpoints and overall design were similar\nto study 006, with the primary endpoint being reduction in monthly migraine days (MMD) vs. baseline\nvs. placebo during the first 12 weeks, and secondary endpoints were similar to those in study 006.\nIn study 011, at least one treatment was received by n = 356 patients in the 100 mg group, 350 in the\n300 mg group and 366 patients in the placebo group. The study was performed in 13 countries, with\nthe majority of study centres and study participants (58%) in the US, 14.4% in the EU (Czech\nRepublic, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Hungary, Italy, Slovakia, United Kingdom) and 27% in other\ncountries (Georgia, Ukraine, Russia). 91% of the participants were white, 8% were black and the rest\nbelonged to other races.\nThe mean age was about 41 years, the mean time since migraine diagnosis was 18 years, around\n88% were women, the mean number of monthly migraine days (MMD) at baseline was 16, the\nnumber of monthly headache days was 20.5, the number of monthly migraine attacks was around 12,\nand patients used acute migraine medication at baseline on 6-7 days. Around 35% of patients had\nmigraine with aura at baseline. Early discontinuation rates were about 6%, with a discontinuation rate\ndue to adverse events of only 1%. Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced\nbetween the treatment groups.\nThe included population and the study design can be regarded as adequate for the requested\nindication. Compliance with eDiary entries was around 90% during the double-blind treatment phase\nweeks 1-12 without relevant differences between treatment groups.\nEfficacy results in chronic migraine:\nIn the primary endpoint analyses, statistically significant differences vs. placebo were reached for\neptinezumab 300 mg (-2.6 MMD) and eptinezumab 100 mg (-2.0 MMD).

        "full_text": "Migraine is a common neurological disorder that affects around 5% of the adult population (1-year\nprevalence: 8% in men, 20% in women) in western countries. It is characterised by episodic, often\ndisabling, headache, associated with sensory (aura) and autonomic symptoms (nausea, vomiting),\nphonophobia and photophobia, and cognitive symptoms. Episodic migraine (EM) is defined as <15\nheadache days per month, although in clinical prophylactic trials a lower threshold of a minimum of 4\nheadache days is often chosen to reflect typical patients in need of a prophylactic treatment. Chronic\nmigraine (CM) is defined as 15 or more headache days per month. At least 8 of these 15 or more\nheadache days have to be typical migraine days (for the exact definition see the International\nClassification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition).\nThere are established and approved substances for the acute treatment of migraine symptoms (such\nas triptans), and substances for the prevention of migraine attacks (such as beta blockers or\ntopiramate).\nGrowing evidence indicates that calcitonin gene-related peptides (CGRPs) play a key role in\nperipheral sensitisation and associated enhanced pain, and that these peptides could be involved in\nmigraine pathophysiology. Blocking the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or the CGRP receptor\nhas emerged as a possible mechanism for the prevention of migraine attacks. Amongst others,\ndecreasing blood flow in cerebral vessels and inhibition of pain transmission in the trigeminal ganglion\nare discussed as possible mechanisms for these antibodies.\nFor several antibodies targeting the CGRP-pathway, effects in preventing migraine have been shown\nin clinical trials and, since 2018, three of these antibodies (erenumab, galcanezumab, fremanezumab)\nhave been approved worldwide for the prophylaxis of episodic and chronic migraine. These\nsubstances show moderate efficacy comparable to established treatment options, combined with a\nrather benign safety profile. Eptinezumab is the fourth anti-CGRP antibody in this indication, but the\nfirst one with an intravenous (vs. subcutaneous) mode of administration.",
        "summary": "Migraines are a headache disorder with repeated, severe headaches and other symptoms that occur as sudden attacks. Women are far more frequently affected by this disorder than men. Depending on the frequency of attacks, migraines are classified as episodic (up to 14 days of headaches per month) or chronic (15 or more days of headaches per month). There are medications for acute treatment and for prevention (prophylaxis) of migraines.\nVyepti reduces the number of attacks or days of migraines and is therefore a preventive treatment. The exact mechanism of action is unknown. However, there is growing evidence that specific proteins known as calcitonin gene-related peptides (CGRPs) play an important role in migraine attacks. The active substance eptinezumab is a monoclonal antibody (immunologically active protein) and blocks the action of these CGRPs in the body.",

        "full_text": "Tafamidis is the first oral drug for the treatment of ATTR-CM.\nThe submitted phase 3 trial demonstrated a reduction of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-\nrelated hospitalisations in selected patients with ATTR-CM.\nSafety results indicated that both dosages of tafamidis, 20 mg and 80 mg once daily, were well\ntolerated.\nOverall, the benefit-risk ratio for tafamidis 80 mg once daily for the treatment of ATTR-CM has been\nassessed to be positive.\nTafamidis should be administered by physicians experienced in amyloidosis therapy.\nClinical Pharmacology \u2013 Beneficial Effects\nTafamidis can be administered independently of meals. Apart from a slightly less than dose\nproportional increase of exposure due to its limited solubility, tafamidis PK is linear. No dose\nadjustments are required in mild or moderate hepatic impairment, renal impairment of all degrees or\nelderly patients.\nTafamidis is unlikely to inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 3A4 in vivo at therapeutic\nexposure. It had no effect on midazolam exposure in a clinical interaction study. Tafamidis is not a\nsubstrate of P-gp, MRP2, OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. In vivo inhibition of P-gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3,\nOCT2, MATE1 and MATE2K is unlikely.\nTafamidis had no effect on QTcF or heart rate at supratherapeutic exposure.\nClinical Pharmacology \u2013 Uncertainties related to the Beneficial Effects\nThe impact of proton-pump inhibitors or other antacids on the absorption of tafamidis is unknown, but\nthe risk of major interactions appears low.\nThe assessment of dose proportionality is largely based on oral solution data. The problem is\nattenuated by the fact that only one dose per formulation is applied for.\nThe metabolism of tafamidis has not been fully characterised. However, glucuronidation has been\nobserved and unchanged tafamidis is the main compound in plasma.\nThere are no data available on subjects with severe hepatic impairment. This point is appropriately\naddressed in the information for healthcare professionals.\nA dose of 20 mg tafamidis meglumine QD was used in the midazolam interaction study. Thus, the\neffect of tafamidis after 80/61 mg QD on midazolam is unknown. The tafamidis dose used in the\ninteraction study is indicated in the corresponding section of the information for healthcare\nprofessionals.\nNo data are available regarding the impact of other drugs (for example UGT inhibitors) on tafamidis\nPK. This point is appropriately addressed in the information for healthcare professionals.\nClinical Pharmacology \u2013 Unfavourable Effects\nTafamidis meglumine and tafamidis free acid are not bioequivalent on a mg basis, i.e. different doses\nare required to achieve comparable tafamidis exposure.\nThe possibility to inhibit BCRP, OAT1, OAT3 and intestinal UTG1A1 in vivo is appropriately\naddressed in the information for healthcare professionals.

Since no clinical safety data were available\nfor the to-be-marketed Gen 2 material, uncertainties remain regarding the safety profile of sotrovimab.\nFurthermore, PK and safety data from ongoing clinical studies using the Gen 2 material were\nrequested as a Clinical Requirement.\nHypersensitivity reactions were deemed as an identified risk (adverse drug reaction). Although\nanaphylaxis was not reported in COMET-ICE, there was one report of a severe immediate\nhypersensitivity reaction in a hospitalised patient with COVID-19 in the ACTIV-3-TICO study. This\ncase met the criteria for an anaphylactic reaction. Furthermore, one case of cytokine release\nsyndrome related to sotrovimab was also observed in the ACTIV-3 TICO study.",

        "full_text": "A single pivotal clinical study (COMET-ICE) was submitted in support of the marketing authorisation\napplication.\nSeveral further studies are currently ongoing with sotrovimab.\nCOMET-ICE was a Phase II/III randomised, multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to\nassess the safety and efficacy of sotrovimab for the early treatment of COVID-19 in non-hospitalised\npatients.\nThe study enrolled non-hospitalised participants with early, mild/moderate COVID-19 who were at risk\nof progression of disease in 57 centres (45 in the USA, 6 in Brazil, 3 in Spain, 2 in Canada, and 1 in\nPeru). The study consisted of a lead-in phase that served as the first-in-human assessment (20\nparticipants [planned 20, actual 21 as 1 subject withdrew on D5 and was replaced] 1:1 randomisation\nsotrovimab vs. placebo) followed by an expansion phase (1340 patients, 1:1 randomisation\nsotrovimab vs. placebo).\nThe study population included non-hospitalised \u2265 18 year-old patients who tested positive for SARS-\nCoV-2, oxygen saturation \u2265 94% on room air (i.e. no supplemental oxygen required), \u2264 5 days from\nonset of symptoms AND at high risk of progression of COVID-19 based on presence of one or more\nof the following risk factors: - diabetes (requiring medication)\n- obesity: BMI (>30-original protocol) >35 kg/m2 (Amendment 1)\n- chronic kidney disease (i.e., eGFR <60 by MDRD)\n- congestive heart failure (NYHA class II or more),\n- chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (history of chronic bronchitis, chronic\n- obstructive lung disease, or emphysema with dyspnoea on physical exertion)\n- moderate to severe asthma (participant requires an inhaled steroid to control symptoms or has\nbeen prescribed a course of oral steroids in the past year)\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants who have progression of COVID-19\nthrough Day 29 as defined by (i) hospitalisation > 24 hours for acute management of illness OR (ii)\ndeath. Other relevant secondary efficacy endpoints at the Day 29 analysis included time to symptom\nalleviation using a self-reporting symptom questionnaire (FLU-PRO Plus) questionnaire, 29-day 60-\nday and 90-day all-cause mortality and change from baseline in viral load in nasal secretions by\nquantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) at Day 8. Of note, the testing\nof secondary endpoints was adjusted for multiplicity by using a pre-defined hierarchy strategy.\nA total of 1351 participants were screened, and 1057 (ITT set) participants were randomly assigned to\nstudy treatment (sotrovimab: 528; placebo: 529). A total of 1049 participants were confirmed to have\nreceived the study treatment (sotrovimab: 523; placebo: 526). Participants in the sotrovimab arm\nreceived a single infusion of 500 mg sotrovimab. Of the 1049 participants, 1037 participants were\nfollowed for >29 days.\nDemographics and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the treatment arms. Median\nage was 53 years. 20% of the studied population were \u2265 65 years old and 11% \u2265 70 years old. The\nmain conditions considered as risk factors were obesity with a BMI >30 kg/m2 (ca. 65% of study\npopulation), age \u2265 55 years (ca. 50%) and diabetes (ca 20%).\nThe Day 29 analysis for the primary endpoint has been conducted on the ITT analysis set (N=1057).\n6/528 (1%) participants met progression criteria for the primary endpoint in the sotrovimab arm vs.\n30/529 (6%) in the Placebo arm. The adjusted risk reduction is 79%. Of note, according to the\napplicant, 3 of the 6 participants in the sotrovimab arm were hospitalised for events potentially\nunrelated to COVID-19, whereas all participants in the Placebo arm were hospitalised due to events\npotentially related to COVID-19. Results for the primary endpoint were consistent with those reported\nin the ITT population when, as a sensitivity analysis, participants with missing primary endpoint data\n(n=7 for sotrovimab, n=5 for placebo) were analysed as treatment failures, with a calculated adjusted\nrisk reduction of 62%. In subgroup analyses, as might be expected, the data generally show a higher\nproportion of progressions in the higher age group (participants >70 years) in both treatment arms,\nbut the sotrovimab arm maintained an advantage. In those \u2264 70 years, the proportions of participants\nwho have progression were <1% and 5% in the sotrovimab and placebo groups, respectively, and in\nthose \u2265 70 years, the proportions of participants who have progression were 4% and 13% in the\nsotrovimab and placebo groups, respectively.\nFor the all-cause mortality assessment by Day 29, 2 participants in the placebo arm had died of\nrespiratory complications (COVID-pneumonia and pneumonia), and no participants in the sotrovimab\narm had died at Day 29. Because of the small number of death events, statistical significance cannot\nbe determined. Nevertheless, the 2 death events at the Day 29 assessment occurred in the placebo\ngroup and were linked to respiratory complications (COVID-pneumonia and pneumonia). Of note,\nbecause of the data cut-off, not all participants could be evaluated for 60-day and 90-day mortality.\nClinical data linked to exploratory endpoints indicated that, compared to placebo, sotrovimab reduced\nthe number of participants who were admitted to hospital and, amongst those who required\nhospitalisation, resulted in a reduction in the duration of hospitalisation, reduced the incidence of an ICU stay (no participants in the sotrovimab arm required an ICU stay), and no participants in the\nsotrovimab arm required mechanical ventilator support.\nThe study was performed at a time when the current variant causing the vast majority of infections in\nEurope (Delta) was not present. Therefore, the clinical efficacy of sotrovimab against this variant is\nnot established. However, in vitro data (pseudotyped virus-like particle neutralisation assays) indicate\nthat sotrovimab retains in vitro activity (i.e. < 5-fold change in IC50) against the variants of concern\nOmicron, Delta (Indian), Beta (South African), Gamma (Brazil), Alpha (UK) and against Epsilon,\nKappa and Iota.\nThe COMET-ICE Virology report (representing sequencing data for 38% of the total participants)\nstates that the amino acid variants were reported at consensus level (\u226515% allelic fraction). Variants\nat position E340 were the most frequently observed variants in the epitope. Variants at two positions,\nE340 and P337, resulted in significant EC50 shifts, indicating reduced susceptibility to sotrovimab.\nSequence and phenotypic analysis for all qualifying participants in COMET-ICE is ongoing, and the\nfinal version of the Virology report will need to be submitted when available (Clinical requirement).\nThe applicant is required to further monitor the in vitro activity of sotrovimab against VOCs, VOIs and\nto conduct pseudovirus and authentic virus assays.",
        "summary": "The efficacy of Xevudy was investigated in the COMET-ICE study with 1,057 patients. The patients were 18 years or older, were not hospitalised, had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and did not require supplemental oxygen. The onset of the COVID-19 symptoms was within the previous 5 days. The patients were at high risk of developing severe COVID-19. 528 people received a single infusion of sotrovimab and 529 people received a dummy drug (placebo). The hospitalisation and mortality rates were determined on day 29 post-infusion. These events (hospitalisation or death) occurred in 1% of the Xevudy group (6 out of 528 people), compared with 6% of the placebo group (30 out of 529 people). This corresponds to a 79% reduction in the risk of severe COVID-19 with Xevudy. The majority of patients in this study were infected with the original strain of SARS-CoV-2. Laboratory studies suggest that Xevudy is also effective against other virus variants such as Omicron (B.1.1.529/BA.1).",

        "full_text": "Vaccines are available and widely used for the prevention of COVID-19, and some therapeutics\nprovide a potential benefit in the later stages of the disease. The early administration of monoclonal\nantibodies is an attractive option to prevent a severe course of the disease, especially in patients with\nrisk factors. Currently, various monoclonal antibodies (used alone or in combination) have been\nengineered to that aim and might also be modified depending on the emergence of virus variants to\npreserve their efficacy.\nSotrovimab is a human SARS-COV-2 neutralising monoclonal antibody. It binds to a highly conserved\nepitope on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, outside of the receptor-\nbinding motif (RBM).\nFor single antibodies, there is a theoretical concern of promoting the emergence of treatment-\nresistant variants. This might be less likely with a combination product.\nA single pivotal study, COMET-ICE (VIR-7831-5001 GSK-214367), was submitted in support of this\nmarketing authorisation application.\nCOMET-ICE is an ongoing randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, placebo-controlled trial of\nsotrovimab for the early treatment of COVID-19 in non-hospitalised participants. The data submitted\nare based on the planned day 29 analysis with all randomised participants (N=1057).\nBeneficial Effects\nSotrovimab has the typical PK profile of an IgG monoclonal antibody with an extended half-life. The\nsotrovimab PK was in the linear range after the administered single dose of 500 mg. Apart from\nweight, none of the covariates investigated (including age, gender, hepatic and renal function) had a\nclinically relevant impact on sotrovimab PK. The simulated sotrovimab tissue concentrations\nexceeded the tissue-adjusted IC90 for 196 days post-dose and the10-fold IC90 for at least 56 days\npost-dose.\nWhen used in high-risk patients, sotrovimab treatment was associated with a significant reduction in\nhospitalisation for the main COVID-19-related morbidities, that is progression of infection in the\nrespiratory tract leading to severe pneumonia and the need for supplemental oxygen and\nhospitalisation.\nIn the COMET-ICE study, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants who have\nprogression of COVID-19 through Day 29 as defined by (i) hospitalisation > 24 hours for acute\nmanagement of illness OR (ii) death. In the ITT analysis (N=1057, 528 patients in the sotrovimab arm\nand 529 patients in the placebo arm) 1% in the sotrovimab treatment group showed progression of\nCOVID-19 vs. 6% in the placebo group, corresponding to a 79% risk reduction. Other relevant\nsecondary efficacy endpoints at the day 29 analysis (time to symptom alleviation using a self-\nreporting symptom questionnaire, change from baseline in viral load, all-cause mortality) were also in\nfavour of the sotrovimab treatment.\nBased on in-vitro data, sotrovimab retains activity against the Delta and Omicron variants. Uncertainties regarding the Beneficial Effects\nThe popPK dataset included only a small number of patients with moderate or severe hepatic or\nsevere renal impairment. Potential pharmacokinetic differences between Gen 1 and Gen 2 material\nare currently under investigation. Therefore, the available PK data of the COMET-ICE study should be\nregarded as preliminary.\nNo formal clinical assessment was conducted to exclude the possibility that the differences between\nGen 1 (used in the pivotal study) and Gen 2 (to-be-marketed) sotrovimab do not have an effect on\nefficacy. Data from clinical studies using the Gen 2 material (as study COMET-PEAK) will be able to\nprovide further information.\nClinical efficacy or PK data for adolescents were not available.\nBased on in vitro pseudotyped virus-like particle neutralisation assays, sotrovimab retains activity\nagainst the variants of concern: Omicron, Delta (and Delta Plus AY.1 and AY.2), Beta, Gamma,\nAlpha, and against Epsilon, Kappa and Iota. Based on an authentic virus assay, sotrovimab is active\nagainst Beta, Gamma and Delta variants, but no data are yet available for the Delta plus and Omicron\nvariants.\nFurthermore, no clinical data are available regarding efficacy against the Delta variant, as none of the\nsubjects included in the study had a Delta variant infection. The rate of subjects infected with the\nAlpha variant was also low (4%).\nNor are there any clinical efficacy data against the Omicron variant that rapidly became the\npredominant variant in Switzerland by the end of December 2021. However, based on the currently\navailable in-vitro (pseudovirus assay) data, Xevudy is expected to be active against the newly\nemerged Omicron variant.\nThe applicant will monitor the presence and emergence of VOCs/VOIs and assess the in vitro activity\nof sotrovimab using a pseudotyped virus system and, when possible, authentic virus. The applicant\nwill also sequence participant samples in ongoing sotrovimab clinical trials and assess sotrovimab\nefficacy in a clinical setting.\nUnfavourable Effects\nThe available PK data were obtained after administration of Gen 1 drug material only. Potential\npharmacokinetic differences between Gen 1 and Gen 2 material are currently under investigation.\nThe safety findings from the pivotal COMET-ICE study were supplemented by safety data from\nstudies in which sotrovimab was utilised in different populations and/or in combination with other\nmonoclonal antibodies.\nIn the review of the totality of the safety data, hypersensitivity reactions were deemed as an identified\nrisk (adverse drug reaction). Although anaphylaxis was not reported in COMET-ICE, there was one\nreport of a severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction in a hospitalised patient with COVID-19 in the\nACTIV-3-TICO study meeting the criteria for an anaphylactic reaction. Furthermore, one case of\ncytokine release syndrome related to sotrovimab was also observed in the ACTIV-3 TICO study.\nUncertainties regarding the Unfavourable Effects\nNo safety data are available for adolescents over 12 years of age.\nNo formal clinical assessment was conducted to exclude the possibility that the differences between\nGen 1 (used in the pivotal study) and Gen 2 (to-be-marketed) sotrovimab have an effect on safety.\nHigher exposure at day 29 for Gen 2 was observed, although the pharmacovigilance on the\nemergency use and marketed use of the Gen 2 material did not identify new safety findings. The\nsafety results from ongoing studies using the Gen 2 material needs to be submitted when available\n(Clinical Requirement). Benefit \u2013Risk Assessment Clinic\nThe overall benefit-risk of sotrovimab for the treatment of mild/moderate COVID-19 to prevent\nprogression to severe COVID-19, the need for oxygen therapy, hospitalisation or death in SARS-CoV-\n2 infected high-risk patients is positive.\nThe available sotrovimab PK data did not raise any concerns. However, due to the still ongoing\nevaluation of possible differences between Gen 1 and Gen 2 material, they should be regarded as\npreliminary.\nEfficacy against the currently most prevalent Omicron variant is clinically not established. However,\nbased on in-vitro pseudotyped virus-like particle neutralisation assays, sotrovimab retains activity -\namong others - against the previously predominant Delta variant and also against the currently\npredominant Omicron variant.\nThe clinical efficacy of sotrovimab against emerging new VOCs remains to be determined and must\nbe actively monitored.",
        "summary": "The COMET-ICE study found that Xevudy can reduce the risk of hospitalisation or death in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who are at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19. COMET-ICE was not conducted in patients who were infected with newer virus variants such as Omicron. The clinical efficacy of Xevudy as regards the new virus variants must therefore be actively monitored.\nThe safety profile of Xevudy is considered to be positive.\nFor these reasons, Xevudy, containing the active substance sotrovimab, has been temporarily authorised in Switzerland (Art. 9a TPA). The temporary authorisation is contingent on the timely submission of the data requested by Swissmedic. Once these authorisation conditions have been met, the temporary authorisation can be converted into an ordinary authorisation in the event of a positive benefit-risk assessment of the results.",

Overall, 96% of patients presented \u2265 grade 3 toxicity, including 55% of patients with drug-related\nTEAEs. The most frequent were anaemia, thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, ALT or AST\nelevation, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, fatigue, diarrhoea, and ECG QT prolonged\n(1.1%).\nDeaths\nOverall, 181 fatal TEAEs were observed in all 522 gilteritinib treated patients. Of these deaths, 18\nwere considered to be drug-related. Drug-related TEAEs leading to death were as follows: septic\nshock (3 patients), sepsis (1), pneumonia (3), respiratory failure (2), cerebral haemorrhage (1), large\nintestinal perforation (2), congestive heart failure (1), cellulitis (1), intracranial haemorrhage (1),\nintestinal ischaemia (1), neutropenia (1), pulmonary embolism (1), ventricular fibrillation (1),\ndepressed level of consciousness (1), haemoptysis (1), and subdural haematoma (1).\nSerious Adverse Events (SAEs)\nSAEs were observed in 33% of patients treated with gilteritinib and comprised febrile neutropenia,\npyrexia and pneumonia, but also transaminases increased, respiratory failure, syncope, and\nhypotension, all considered drug-related by the investigators.\nTEAEs leading to withdrawal of treatment\nTreatment withdrawal due to TEAEs was observed in 10% of patients, and the most frequent reasons\nwere increased transaminases and pneumonia. Approximately 43% of patients had treatment\ninterruptions due to adverse events (AEs) and 20% had dose-reductions.\nAEs of special interest were defined by the applicant and comprised PRES (posterior reversible\nencephalopathy syndrome), cardiac failure, pericarditis, QT prolongation, creatine phosphokinase\nelevation and myopathy, liver transaminases elevation, differentiation syndrome, gastrointestinal\nobstruction, perforation and bleeding, pancreatitis, and drug hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis. All of these\nAEs were described in at least one patient and are considered safety risks. Most of these are rare\nevents except for the transaminase increase that was observed in more than one third of patients, as\nwell as creatine phosphokinase increase and QT prolongation that were also observed with\nfrequencies of 10% and 7%, respectively.\nConclusion safety: Gilteritinib increased liver transaminases and caused hematologic toxicity, which is\nconfounded by the underlying disease and previous treatments. The same is true for the high\nincidence of infectious complications under gilteritinib. Another safety issue is cardiac safety with\nseveral cardiac deaths in the gilteritinib-treated patients versus none in the chemotherapy control\ngroup and the documented QT prolongation under gilteritinib. Cases of PRES, pancreatitis and\ndifferentiation syndrome have been observed under gilteritinib and need to be monitored.",

        "full_text": "The application is based on one pivotal study 2215-CL-0301, the ADMIRAL trial. This trial included\nadult patients with FLT3-mutated AML that had relapsed after one prior line of treatment or that was\nrefractory to first line treatment. Patients with secondary AML (treatment-induced; very poor\nprognosis) or with promyelocytic leukaemia (excellent outcome with treatment by retinoic acid and\narsenic) were not eligible.\nADMIRAL was a phase 3 superiority trial comparing the efficacy of gilteritinib with standard salvage\nchemotherapy in relapsed/refractory AML patients presenting FLT3 mutations (FLT3-ITD, FLT3-\nTKD/D835 or FLT3-TKD/I836). Patients had to be eligible for rescue chemotherapy of the\ninvestigator\u2019s choice, have normal renal and liver function, no GVHD (graft-versus-host disease) and\nan ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of 0-2. The chemotherapy\ncontrol arm was an investigator\u2019s choice between 4 different regimens (two low-dose [low-dose\ncytarabine and azacitidine] and two high-dose [MEC and [FLAG-IDA] regimens). No formal criteria\nwere described on how patients were pre-selected for high-dose versus low-dose salvage therapy.\nPatients were stratified based on their response to first-line treatment and according to salvage\nchemotherapy (low-dose or high-dose) pre-determined by the investigator before randomisation. Sixty\npercent (60%) of patients were pre-determined for high-dose and 40% for low-dose chemotherapy (without specification of the exact regimen), and this was well balanced between the two treatment\narms, as could be expected given the stratification for this variable.\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. While the study was already recruiting, a co-\nprimary endpoint of CR/CRh rate was added for the gilteritinib arm. At the same time an interim\nanalysis was added when approximately 141 patients were randomised to the gilteritinib arm and\nwere at least 112 days (4 treatment cycles) past the first dose of gilteritinib or randomisation (for\npatients who did not receive gilteritinib). This co-primary endpoint was only to be analysed during this\nnew interim analysis and showed a CR/CRh rate that allowed for continuation of the study (lower\nbound of the 95% CI above 12% which corresponds to previously described response rates with\nchemotherapy in this indication). Alpha spending was correctly performed for the statistical analysis\nplan. Key secondary endpoints were event-free survival (EFS) and CR rate, as well as safety.\nGilteritinib was administered orally without food once a day continuously at 120 mg (3 tablets of 40\nmg). Chemotherapy regimens were administered according to published standards. High-dose\nchemotherapy was assessed with bone marrow (BM) aspiration after one cycle (approximately day\n15), and the treatment decision was based on response and BM cellularity. Low-dose chemotherapy\nand gilteritinib were continued until toxicity, progression, lack of efficacy (no response) or no more\nclinical benefit according to the investigator. Gilteritinib could be dose-reduced to 80 mg and then 40\nmg. If 40 mg once daily was not tolerated, then no further dose-reduction was allowed, and treatment\nhad to be discontinued. Dose-interruptions were allowed for a maximum of 14 days, after which\ntreatment had to be definitively discontinued. No re-escalation was allowed.\nFor gilteritinib, azacitidine and LoDAC (low-dose cytarabine), treatment was continued until\nprogression, intolerable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. For the higher dose chemotherapy\nregimens, treatment could also be interrupted due to lack of efficacy after one cycle, or if patients\nwent on to HSCT. After treatment discontinuation, patients had an end of treatment visit within 7 days\nafter treatment discontinuation, followed by a 30-day follow-up. After that, patients entered the long-\nterm follow-up every 3 months for overall survival only.\nThe study planned to randomise 369 patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive gilteritinib or salvage\nchemotherapy. For the final analysis, the planned 258 death events provide about 90% power to\ndetect a difference in OS between the gilteritinib arm with 7.7 months median survival time and\nsalvage chemotherapy arm with 5 months median survival time (HR = 0.65) at the overall 1-sided\n0.0245 significance level.\nA total of 371 patients were randomised, 247 to the gilteritinib arm and 124 to salvage chemotherapy.\nIn the salvage chemotherapy, fewer patients received treatment (87.9%) compared to the gilteritinib\narm (99.6%). At the 30-day follow-up, there was a higher rate of patient withdrawals in the\nchemotherapy control arm (19 [15.3%]) versus 5 (2.0%) in the gilteritinib arm). In the long-term safety\nfollow-up there were more patient withdrawals in the chemotherapy arm, with 18.5% compared to the\ngilteritinib arm with 2.8%. This withdrawal to follow-up has an even greater impact since follow-up\ntime was short in the salvage chemotherapy arm that foresaw only one visit at 30 days after\ncompletion of treatment and then only a survival status check via telephone contact every 3 months.\nGiven that the majority of patients were preselected for high-dose chemotherapy, which was\nadministered for a maximum of two cycles, follow-up time was, at most, 3 months, and this in a\npopulation of patients with an expected median OS of 5 months (according to the statistical analysis\nplan). There were only 56.5% of patients in the salvage chemotherapy arm versus 87.9% in the\ngilteritinib arm who fell into the per protocol analysis set.\nOverall, there were slightly more than 10% of patients with protocol deviations. These were balanced\nbetween the arms and should not therefore influence the interpretation of the study results. The\nbaseline characteristics were well balanced. Most patients fall into the intermediate cytogenetic risk\ngroup (73%), but approximately 10% had unfavourable cytogenetics. About 16% of patients were not classifiable into favourable, intermediate, or unfavourable risk. Approximately 40% of patients were \u2265\n65 years old and > 80% had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. There were no significant\ndifferences between the two arms regarding prior therapy and response to prior therapy, duration of\nresponse, and time since diagnosis. No information was provided on therapies received after study\nparticipation.\nTreatment exposure was shorter in the chemotherapy arm, particularly since a majority of patients\nreceived high-dose chemotherapy that was pre-defined for one or two cycles only. Median duration of\nexposure to gilteritinib was 126 days.\nOS was significantly longer in the gilteritinib arm in the ITT population, with a median OS of 9.3\n(95% CI: 7.7, 10.7) months compared to the salvage chemotherapy arm with a median of 5.6 (95%\nCI: 4.7, 7.3) months using a Kaplan-Meier estimate (HR: 0.637; 95% CI: 0.490, 0.830; 1-sided P-\nvalue 0.0004). The survival probability was higher in the gilteritinib arm compared to the salvage\nchemotherapy arm at 6 months (65.5% versus 48.9%) and 12 months (37.1% versus 16.7%).\nRegarding secondary endpoints, the study did not show a significant improvement in EFS (event-free\nsurvival). The other key secondary endpoint was CR/CRh rate, which was to be tested hierarchically\nafter EFS. Given that EFS was not statistically significant, the CR/CRh rate is only exploratory, but\nshows a trend towards higher response rates in the gilteritinib arm compared to the chemotherapy\narm. Median time to response in the gilteritinib arm was 3.7 months.\nPatients who were eligible per the institutional guidelines and had a suitable donor were allowed to\nproceed to HSCT. While patients in the chemotherapy arm went off study at HSCT and were only\nfollowed for OS, patients in the gilteritinib arm were allowed to continue on study and could resume\ngilteritinib after successful HSCT. More patients in the gilteritinib group went on to receive HSCT\n(25.5% versus 15.3% in the gilteritinib and salvage chemotherapy arms, respectively).\nEfficacy conclusion: Gilteritinib increased median OS in the ITT population compared to salvage\nchemotherapy from 5.6 months to 9.3 months with an HR of 0.637; 95% CI: 0.490, 0.830 and a 1-\nsided P-value of 0.0004. The survival probability was higher in the gilteritinib arm compared to the\nsalvage chemotherapy arm at 6 months (65.5% versus 48.9%) and 12 months (37.1% versus 16.7%)\nwhen at 12 months 25% of the gilteritinib population and 10% of the chemotherapy population\nremained at risk. The secondary endpoint of improved EFS was not reached. CR/CRh rates were\nbetter in the gilteritinib arm, at 34.0% [84/247]) compared to the salvage chemotherapy arm (15.3%\n[19/124]). Transfusion-dependency was another secondary endpoint. Among the 197 patients in the\ngilteritinib arm who were dependent on RBC and/or platelet transfusions at baseline, 68 (34.5%)\nbecame independent of RBC and platelet transfusions during any 56-day postbaseline period. For the\n49 patients who were independent of both RBC and platelet transfusions at baseline, 29 (59.2%)\nremained transfusion-independent during any 56-day postbaseline period.",

        "full_text": "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a biologically heterogeneous disease that is rapidly fatal if left\nuntreated. Incidence of AML increases with age. The WHO classification of AML is based on\nmicroscopic, cytogenetic, and molecular characteristics. Therapy is individually tailored to each\npatient according to the biology of the disease and the age and comorbidities of the patient. For fit\npatients, the therapeutic intent is curative. FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication\n(FLT3-ITD) mutations have been associated with increased risk of relapse, while the prognostic\nrelevance of FLT3-tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations is controversial.\nThe majority of patients, who relapse after initial complete response (CR), will relapse within 3 years\nafter diagnosis. There is no standard treatment regimen defined for relapsed and/or refractory (R/R)\nAML. No clinical trial has shown superiority of any particular treatment combination. Salvage therapy\naims at achieving a second CR in order to propose HSCT for fit candidates. The likelihood of\nachieving a second CR is best in patients with a long first remission, younger age, and in those with favourable cytogenetics. For patients who are not candidates for a new high-dose induction therapy,\nhypomethylating agents are an alternative. Response rates for salvage chemotherapies lie between\n32-79%, and median OS remains poor at 3-12 months.\nThere is a high unmet medical need.\nGilteritinib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase.\nFLT3 is often mutated in AML and confers a poor prognosis. Gilteritinib is an oral medication, taken\nonce a day without food in a continuous manner. In the phase 3 ADMIRAL trial, it was shown to\nimprove overall survival in relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML patients who had received one\nprior line of therapy compared to the investigator's choice chemotherapy from 5.6 months to 9.3\nmonths with an HR of 0.637 (95% CI: 0.490- to 0.830, p=0.0004 one-sided log rank test). Overall,\nresponse rate was a key secondary endpoint and was in favour of gilteritinib compared to\nchemotherapy with 21.1% vs 10.5%, respectively, obtaining a CR. However, due to the hierarchical\ntesting strategy to preserve the alpha-level, this difference cannot be considered statistically\nsignificant since event-free survival, which was ahead in the hierarchy, was not significant.\nNevertheless, the difference is clinically important.\nMedian duration of CR in the gilteritinib arm was 14.8 months, and the overall OS analysis in the ITT\npopulation showed a survival benefit of nearly 4 months in favour of gilteritinib. The stress test\nperformed to weigh the early censoring of patients in the chemotherapy arm was consistent with the\nprimary analysis. In addition, in the gilteritinib arm 34% of transfusion dependent patients became\ntransfusion independent, and 60% of transfusion independent patients remained so on gilteritinib.\nGilteritinib increases liver transaminases and creatine phosphokinase. One patient in the overall\nsafety population experienced rhabdomyolysis. Gilteritinib induces a QT-prolongation. Gilteritinib has\nhaematological toxicity with higher rates of cytopenia, particularly compared to low-dose\nchemotherapy. There were treatment-related deaths in the gilteritinib treatment arm, mostly due to\ninfections but also to cardiac events including ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. Cases\nof posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) were observed under gilteritinib. There were\nevents of pancreatitis under gilteritinib. Differentiation syndrome was also described as an adverse\nevent of gilteritinib.\nTo compare toxicity of gilteritinib to chemotherapy was challenging given the 2:1 randomisation with\nfewer patients in the chemotherapy arm and the heterogeneous treatments with four different\nregimens in the control arm. Separate analyses for toxicity of patients treated with gilteritinib\ncompared to patients treated with low-dose chemotherapy exclusively in patients pre-selected for low-\ndose chemotherapy, showed higher incidences of TEAEs, grade 3/4 AEs and SAEs in patients\ntreated with gilteritinib. When comparing patients pre-selected for high-dose chemotherapy and\ntreated with gilteritinib with patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy, toxicity was similar. The\ndifference is that high-dose chemotherapy was administered over a much shorter time period. Overall,\ncomparative safety data are limited and safety data rely mostly on non-comparative observations.\nTherefore, in view of the OS benefit, the higher ORR with a long duration of response and\nmanageable toxicity the benefit-risk profile is evaluated as positive.",
        "summary": "Acute myeloid leukaemia is a form of blood cancer that is quickly fatal if left untreated.\nThe studies showed that patients treated with Xospata survived longer.\nComparing the side effects between gilteritinib and chemotherapy was challenging because fewer participants received chemotherapy and four different chemotherapy regimens were administered (two high-dose and two low-dose regimens).\nPatients treated with gilteritinib reported more side effects than those treated with low-dose chemotherapy. Side effects were similar when comparing gilteritinib with high-dose chemotherapy.\nTaking into account all the available data, the benefits of Xospata outweigh the risks. Swissmedic has therefore authorised the medicine Xospata with the active ingredient gilteritinib for use in Switzerland.",

        "full_text": "6.4 Safety\nA total of 3,441 subjects were exposed to ozanimod in the clinical studies (2,787 subjects with RMS,\n654 subjects with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease), including 3,276 subjects treated with\nozanimod 0.92 mg and 1,098 subjects treated with ozanimod 0.46 mg.\nApproximately 92% of patients in both pivotal studies (SUNBEAM, RADIANCE) were exposed to\nozanimod or IFN \u03b2-1a for at least 12 months, and approximately 34% of subjects were exposed to\nozanimod or IFN \u03b2-1a for at least 24 months.\nTotal cumulative exposures to ozanimod 0.92 mg and 0.46 mg were 1,323.3 and 1,318.0 patient-\nyears, respectively.\nThe adverse reactions presented in the information for healthcare professionals are based on safety\ninformation from 882 patients treated with ozanimod 0.92 mg and 885 treated with IFN beta-1a.\nThe most common adverse reactions were nasopharyngitis (11%), increased levels of alanine\naminotransferase (5%) and increased levels of gamma-glutamyltransferase (5%).\nThe incidences of severe adverse events (AEs) were low and similar across the ozanimod 0.92 mg,\nozanimod 0.46 mg, and IFN \u03b2-1a treatment groups (2.5%, 3.3%, and 3.3%, respectively). The\nincidence of moderate AEs was lower in the ozanimod treatment groups compared with the IFN \u03b2-1a\ntreatment group, largely due to the higher incidence of moderate influenza-like illness in the IFN \u03b2-1a\ngroup.\nThere were six subject deaths over the entire ozanimod clinical development programme as of 30 Jun\n2018. All subjects had exposure to study drug with ozanimod. Even though all cases were considered\nto be unrelated to study drug by the investigator/sponsor, one case of posterior reversible\nencephalopathy syndrome (PRES) during treatment with ozanimod 0.92mg resulted in chronic kidney\nfailure after discontinuation of the study drug, which might be considered to be a consequence of the\ntreatment with ozanimod. A secondary connection due to autonomic dysfunction and/or therapy with\nimmunoglobulins with a previously occurring Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) (Basavaraj et al., 2014)\nunder treatment with ozanimod cannot be excluded in this case.\nA warning in the product information concerning PRES was implemented.\nBased on the known biology of S1P modulators, special attention was paid to the assessment of\ncardiac effects, hepatic effects, infections, consequences of lymphopenia, macular oedema,\nmalignancies, and pulmonary effects. Depression and suicidality were also identified for detailed\nanalysis because of their association with the underlying disease state.\nCardiac effects\nIn the phase 3 studies of approximately 1,774 subjects treated with ozanimod, initiation of the dose\nescalation regimen resulted in modest and not clinically meaningful reductions in heart rate (HR) on\nDay 1 (mean HR reduction from baseline of 1.2 bpm with a nadir at Hour 5, with return towards\nbaseline by Hour 6). There were no reports of HR < 40 bpm. There were no occurrences of second-\nor third-degree AV block. It should be noted that patients with clinically significant cardiovascular\nhistory were excluded from these studies, as were patients taking medications that reduce HR or\naffect cardiac conduction.\nWith the help of the selected dose escalation regimen, the cardiac safety profile is improved to a\ncertain extent. However, the risk of bradyarrhythmia is still maintained in all patients, not only in\npatients with certain pre-existing cardiac conditions. The need for additional monitoring, at least\nduring treatment initiation, was questioned and according contraindications and warnings\nimplemented in the labelling. Before initiation of treatment with ozanimod, an ECG should be\nperformed in all patients to determine whether any pre-existing cardiac conditions are present.\nA 6-hour monitoring for signs and symptoms of symptomatic bradycardia is recommended after\nadministration of the first dose in the case of patients with a resting HR <55 bpm, second-degree\n[Mobitz type I] AV block or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure. During chronic treatment in the phase 3 studies, subjects treated with ozanimod 0.92 mg for up to 24\nmonths showed an increase in supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) versus IFN \u03b2-1a of 1.6 mm Hg\nand a 0.9 mm Hg increase versus IFN \u03b2-1a in supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP).\nHypertension as an AE was reported in a greater proportion of subjects in the ozanimod treatment\ngroups compared with IFN \u03b2-1a (3.4%, 3.5%, and 2.0% in the ozanimod 0.92 mg, ozanimod 0.46 mg,\nand IFN \u03b2-1a treatment groups, respectively).\nThe incidence of AEs in the cardiac disorders and vascular disorders system organ classes (SOCs)\ndid not increase with longer term exposure with ozanimod 0.92 mg.\nHepatic effects\nConsistent with what has been observed with other S1P receptor modulators, hepatic enzyme\nelevations, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma-\nglutamyltransferase (GGT), were seen with ozanimod treatment.\nPre-existing liver disease or male gender may be risk factors for the development of elevated hepatic\nenzymes when taking ozanimod. Therefore, ozanimod should be used with caution in these patients\nand is contraindicated in patients with severe pre-existing liver damage (Child-Pugh Class C).\nIn the pivotal trials, elevations of ALT to 5-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) or above has occurred\nin 1.6% of patients treated with 0.92 mg of ozanimod and 1.3% of patients treated with IFN beta-1a.\nElevations of 3-fold the ULN or above has occurred in 5.5% of patients on ozanimod and 3.1% of\npatients on IFN beta-1a. The median time to elevation of 3-fold the ULN was 6 months. The majority\n(79%) continued the treatment with ozanimod, with the values returning to < 3-fold the ULN within\napproximately 2 to 4 weeks.\nIn clinical trials, ozanimod has been discontinued for a confirmed elevation greater than 5-fold the\nULN. Overall, the discontinuation rate due to elevations in hepatic enzymes has been 1.1% of\npatients on 0.92 mg of Zeposia and 0.8% of patients on IFN beta-1a.\nNo case of Hy's law was documented.\nSmall increases in mean total bilirubin, primarily unconjugated bilirubin, occurred with ozanimod\nrelative to IFN \u03b2-1a. Subjects with underlying total bilirubin elevation, including those with Gilbert\u2019s\nsyndrome, may be at increased risk of developing elevated bilirubin when taking ozanimod.\nElevations that occurred in hepatic tests occurred were generally asymptomatic and resolved with\ncontinued treatment and were not observed to lead to severe drug-induced liver injury.\nInfections\nOzanimod causes a mean reduction in the peripheral blood lymphocyte count to 45% of baseline\nvalues because of the reversible retention of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues. Ozanimod may,\ntherefore, increase the susceptibility to infections.\nIn the phase 3 RMS studies, the incidence of infections was similar between the ozanimod (0.92 mg\nand 0.46 mg) and IFN \u03b2-1a treatment groups (35.1%, 33.9%, 34.5%, respectively). Adverse events of\ninfections leading to discontinuation of study drug were low (0.1% in all 3 treatment groups).\nOzanimod treatment in the OLE for up to 68 months demonstrated that the rate of overall infections,\nserious infections, and opportunistic infections did not increase over time.\nThe most frequently reported infections with ozanimod that occurred at \u2265 1% higher incidence than\nwith IFN \u03b2-1a were non-serious infections of the upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis,\nviral respiratory tract infection) and urinary tract infection. The incidence of serious infections was low\nand similar across treatment groups.\nThere were no disseminated or serious opportunistic infections reported with ozanimod treatment.\nThe majority of serious infections were typical bacterial infections and resolved without clinical\nsequelae following standard medical management. Herpes zoster, an opportunistic infection of\nspecial interest, was infrequent in ozanimod groups but tended to increase in frequency with time.\nNo serious infections were reported in subjects with an ALC < 0.2 x 109\n.\nNo case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been reported so far. Macular oedema (MO)\nIn the ozanimod RMS programme, optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used as a standard\nscreening tool to identify subjects for further ophthalmologic examination. No trend in macular\nthickness changes were noted over time with repeat OCTs with mild increases balanced across\ngroups.\nA total of 7/2,787 subjects (0.3%) in the RMS clinical programme with ozanimod treatment had\nconfirmed MO. Two confirmed cases were identified in the IBD programme. Overall, there were\n9/3,441 (0.3%) confirmed cases of MO reported in the entire ozanimod programme. All cases of\nconfirmed MO were identified with OCT findings consistent with MO, and all cases were associated\nwith pre-existing risk factors or comorbid conditions that are known to cause MO. Eight of the 9\nsubjects recovered following discontinuation of study drug; the remaining case (secondary to ocular\ntrauma) was reported to be stable as of the last available follow-up. No confirmed cases were seen in\nthe IFN \u03b2-1a treatment group.\nMalignancies\nMalignancies were examined due to the potential effects of ozanimod as an immunomodulatory\nagent. In the pivotal trials, the incidence of AEs in the SOC of Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and\nUnspecified (including Cysts and Polyps) was similar across treatment groups (21 [2.4%] subjects,\nozanimod 0.92 mg; 19 [2.1%] subjects, ozanimod 0.46 mg; 24 [2.7%] subjects, IFN \u03b2-1a).\nSubjects with a history of malignancies (other than treated basal cell carcinoma) were excluded from\nthe phase 3 RMS studies.\nOf the 10 total malignancies in the ozanimod groups (including 2 that were retrospectively determined\nto be pre-existing), 5 were cutaneous and 5 were non-cutaneous.\nThe most frequently reported cutaneous malignancy with ozanimod was basal cell carcinoma (n = 3)\nand the most frequently reported non-cutaneous malignancies, consistent with the mostly female\nRMS population, were breast cancers (n = 3). There were 2 malignancies in the IFN \u03b2-1a treatment\ngroup, a basal cell carcinoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.\nPulmonary Effects\nPulmonary function is known to be affected by other S1P receptor modulators, and patients with MS\nmay be at increased risk of respiratory problems.\nPulmonary safety for ozanimod was examined in the clinical development programme using\nspirometry, diffusing capacity (DLCO) and AEs related to pulmonary function designated as adverse\nevents of special interest (AESIs) in Phase 2 and Phase 3 RMS studies.\nSmall decreases in these spirometry assessments were observed in the ozanimod 0.92 mg treatment\ngroup relative to the 0.46 mg or IFN \u03b2-1a treatment groups with up to 24 months of treatment. These\nchanges were not clinically meaningful and were primarily driven by changes during the first\n3 months. These early small changes for the 0.92 mg ozanimod dose were not progressive through\n12 months.\nOf 8 subjects with concurrent decreases in forced vital capacity (FVC) and DLCO (5 of these came\nfrom one investigator site), the baseline % predicted FVC was greater than 100 in 7 out of 8 with the 2\nhighest likely representing erroneous and/or unphysiological values.\nCollectively, the declines in FVC in these subjects may represent regression to the mean or learning\neffect rather than a clinically significant reduction in lung function.\nAbsolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC)\nDecreases in ALC are an expected treatment effect of ozanimod and were observed as early as\n1 month after the start of therapy. For subjects in the ozanimod 0.92 mg and ozanimod 0.46 mg\ngroups, sustained reduction was seen throughout the treatment period.\nThe decrease in ALC was dose-dependent. The number of subjects with an ALC < 0.2 x 109/L was\nhigher in the 0.92 mg ozanimod group (n = 29, 3.3%) than in the ozanimod 0.46 mg group (n = 4, 0.4%) and the IFN \u03b2-1a (n = 0). The majority of these subjects (22/29 [75.9%] in the ozanimod 0.92\nmg group and 3/4 [75%] in the ozanimod 0.46 mg group) recovered to levels \u2265 0.2 x 109/L while on\ntreatment.\nLymphocyte counts collected from approximately 200 subjects following discontinuation of study drug\nallowed for a post hoc assessment of off-treatment recovery of ALC).\nBased on the Kaplan-Meier estimate, the median time to recovery of ALC to the normal range (\u2265 1 x\n109/L) was 30 days after treatment discontinuation in the ozanimod 0.92 mg treatment group and 28\ndays after treatment discontinuation in the ozanimod 0.46 mg treatment group. In the ozanimod 0.92\nmg treatment group, approximately 80% of subjects recovered to the normal range 2 months after\ntreatment discontinuation and approximately 90% recovered to the normal range 3 months after\ntreatment discontinuation. In the ozanimod 0.46 mg treatment group, approximately 80% of subjects\nrecovered to the normal range approximately 35 days after treatment discontinuation and\napproximately 90% of subjects recovered to the normal range 2 months after treatment\ndiscontinuation.\nCholesterol/lipoprotein\nModest, dose-dependent, non-progressive increases from baseline in total cholesterol and low-\ndensity lipoprotein (LDL) levels were observed at Month 6 with ozanimod 0.92 mg and 0.46 mg\nrelative to IFN \u03b2-1a. These changes were accompanied by corresponding increases in high-density\nlipoprotein (HDL) and no meaningful changes in triglyceride levels.\nDepression and suicidal ideation or behaviour\nAcross the ozanimod programme, the incidence of depression and suicidal ideation or behaviour was\ninfrequent, balanced across the treatment groups, and consistent with the background rates of these\nevents for the MS patient population.\nPregnancy/Lactation\nNon-clinical toxicology data suggest that ozanimod may - like other S1P receptor modulators - harm\nthe unborn baby. As long as no sufficient clinical data with ozanimod are available, and as long as the\nresults with S1P receptor modulators are inconclusive, pregnancy is a contraindication for the\ntreatment of ozanimod. A follow-up on pregnancy outcomes in the development programme for\nozanimod in the post-marketing setting as well as in the clinical trial programme (ongoing open-label\nextension study) is mandatory to gather sufficient data on this topic.\nAvailable pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of ozanimod/metabolites in milk.\nPhysicochemical data suggest the excretion of ozanimod and/or its metabolites in human milk. A risk\nto newborns/infants cannot be excluded.",

Demonstration of efficacy for 0.46 mg was less robust since\nthis dose did not show a significant effect for the primary endpoint in RADIANCE when considering\nthe preferred negative binomial model strategy. In SUNBEAM and RADIANCE, treatment with ozanimod 0.92 mg resulted in reductions in mean\npercent change from baseline in normalised brain volume compared to IFN beta-1a IM (-0.41%\nversus -0.61%, and -0.71% versus -0.94%, respectively, nominal p-value <0.0001 for both studies).\nThe studies enrolled DMT-naive and previously treated patients with active disease, as defined by\nclinical or imaging features. Post-hoc analyses of patient populations with differing baseline levels of\ndisease activity, including active and highly active disease, showed that the efficacy of ozanimod on\nclinical and imaging endpoints was consistent with the overall population.\nIndependently of the DMT-status, efficacy for ozanimod on CDP (-3M and -6M) was not\ndemonstrated. This is in line with the original analysis of the key secondary endpoint \u201cconfirmed\ndisability progression\u201d at 3 months (p=0.7651) and 6 months (p=0.1126).\nIn general, an effective treatment intended to modify the natural course of relapsing (remitting)\nmultiple sclerosis has to show an effect on both relapses and progression.

The second, RADIANCE, with 1,313 patients, lasted two years.\nBoth studies compared the active substance ozanimod with a known multiple sclerosis treatment called interferon beta-1a. In these studies, participants were monitored for relapses and the number and size of lesions in the brain and spinal cord. Lesions are areas of damage which become visible on MRI images as the disease progresses.\nThe average number of relapses was significantly lower in participants who received the active substance ozanimod than in those who received the standard treatment. The number and size of lesions were also smaller in the ozanimod group. However, there was no significant difference in the rate of progression of disability between those treated with ozanimod and those treated with interferon beta-1a.\n",

It only\nhas a minor effect on the other S1P receptors (S1P2-4).\nThe application of ozanimod is based on two double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled pivotal\nparallel-group studies (SUNBEAM, RADIANCE).\nThe proposed indication was initially RMS. Since the majority of the study population (98.2%) had\nRRMS the indication was revised accordingly.\nTreatment with ozanimod 0.92 mg showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful differences\nrelative to the active comparator IFN \u03b2-1a in all relapse-based and MRI measures of MS disease\nactivity in both pivotal studies. The secondary endpoints CDP-3M and CDP-6M were not statistically significant for both doses of\nozanimod. This might be explained by the relatively short duration of the controlled study phase (12\nmonths, 24 months) and the choice of an active comparator.\nA numerical dose-dependent effect was observed favouring the 0.92 mg dose over the 0.46 mg dose\nin both studies.\nOzanimod demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and was generally well tolerated with\napproximately 90% completion rates in the pivotal studies.\nPotential risks [e.g. bradycardia, liver injury, infections (with/without prolonged lymphopenia), macular\noedema, PRES, PML, long-term risk of malignancy, effects of withdrawal/rebound] are addressed in\nthe information for healthcare professionals.\nWith the help of the selected dose escalation regimen the cardiac safety profile is improved to a\ncertain extent. Despite that, there is still a remaining risk of bradyarrhythmia. An ECG is to be\nperformed in all patients in order to establish the presence of pre-existing cardiac abnormalities. In\npatients with certain pre-existing conditions, first-dose monitoring is recommended.\nBased on post-marketing data, the possibility that recommendations on first-dose monitoring will have\nto be adjusted later on cannot be ruled out.\nNon-clinical toxicology data suggest that ozanimod may harm the unborn baby. As long as clinical\nexperience is insufficient to reach a final recommendation, pregnancy and lactation are\ncontraindications for the treatment of ozanimod. A follow-up on pregnancy outcomes in the\ndevelopment programme for ozanimod in the post-marketing setting as well as in the clinical trial\nprogramme (ongoing open-label extension study) is mandatory to gather sufficient data on this topic.\nIn conclusion, the benefit / risk assessment of ozanimod in the indication \"Zeposia is indicated for the\ntreatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.\" is considered to be positive.",

        "full_text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, predominantly immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the\ncentral nervous system (CNS), affecting approximately 2.5 million individuals worldwide.\nMS is characterised by autoreactive lymphocytes that attack and destroy the myelin sheath\nsurrounding nerve cells, resulting in demyelination, axonal damage and disruption of the blood-brain\nbarrier, causing neurological impairment and severe disability.\nThe prevalence is 100-150 per 100,000 inhabitants. Around 8,000-10,000 people with MS live in\nSwitzerland (CH). The annual incidence is circa 3.5\u20135 per 100,000 inhabitants (CH: 4.0\u20135.5 /\n100,000) and is increasing according to data from Scandinavian registries.\nClinically, MS starts in approximately 85% of patients as relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), with variable\ndisease activity interspersed with periods of stability. The onset of RRMS typically occurs between the\nages of 20 and 40 and predominantly affects women (2 to 3 times more frequently than men).\nApproximately 70% of patients with RRMS develop, within the first 10 to 15 years after diagnosis, a\nsecondary progressive MS (SPMS), which is characterised by worsening of disability in the absence\nor independent of relapses.\nRelapsing forms of MS (RMS) include patients with RRMS, patients with clinically isolated syndrome\n(CIS \u2013 refers to the first clinical event and evidence of dissemination of lesions in time and space on\nthe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan) and those with SPMS with superimposed relapses.\nThere are no clear criteria that mark the transition from RRMS to SPMS.\nAdditionally, around 15% of patients demonstrate progressive neurological deterioration without\nsuperimposed relapses at the beginning of the disease. This form is called primary progressive MS\n(PPMS), begins typically in the 4th or 5th decade of life and affects men equally as women.\nThe current therapeutic approach of treating RMS involves symptomatic treatment, treatment of acute\nrelapses, and disease modifying therapies (DMTs). The goal of a DMT is to modify the natural course\nof disease by reducing the rate of relapses and MRI disease activity, and delay disability progression.\nThere are a number of DMTs available for the treatment of MS with different mechanisms of\naction and differentiated efficacy and safety profiles, but there is still no cure available for MS.\nSphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulation has been shown to be a highly effective\ntreatment for MS (Brinkman, 2010). Antagonism of S1P receptor type 1 (S1P1) inhibits the egress of\nlymphocytes from lymph nodes, thereby decreasing circulating lymphocytes (Scott, 2016; Tran,\n2017), and preclinical evidence suggests that S1P1 and sphingosine 1-phosphate 5 receptor (S1P5)\nmodulation also may have direct CNS effects resulting in reduction of inflammatory cytokines,\ndemyelination, and axonal loss, and preservation of GABAergic transmission. (Gentile, 2016; Groves,\n2013; Slowik, 2015).\nOzanimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist, which binds with high affinity and\nselectively to S1P subtypes 1 (S1P1) and 5 (S1P5). It is 10-fold more selective for S1P1 relative to\nS1P5 and has little activity on the other S1P receptors (S1P2, S1P3, and S1P4). Ozanimod causes\ninternalisation of S1P1 and retention of lymphocytes in the lymphoid tissues, as evidenced by a dose-\ndependent reduction in peripheral lymphocyte count.",
        "summary": "Ozanimod, the active substance in Zeposia, is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator. Ozanimod works by retaining lymphocytes, disease-fighting white blood cells, within the tissues that create them, such as lymph nodes and the spleen.\nIt is believed that ozanimod is effective because the lymphocytes held back in the lymphatic tissue are unable to cross the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system.\nBy preventing lymphocytes from reaching the central nervous system, ozanimod reduces the inflammatory reactions that damage the brain and spinal cord.",

Although most patients with metastatic disease initially respond to platinum-based\ntherapy, the vast majority of patients will relapse and/or progress after the initial treatment. There has\nbeen a lack of advancements in the second-line setting for decades. Monotherapy with\ntopoisomerase inhibitor is associated with a high frequency of haematological toxicities. There is an\nunmet medical need for a therapy option with a more favourable safety profile that improves the\nsurvival outcomes of these patients.\nThe pivotal data to support the requested indication are based on 105 patients from the SCLC cohort\nof the Phase 2 single-arm Study PM1183-B-005-14. This study included SCLC patients after\nplatinum-based chemotherapy, but excluded patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases.\nThe exclusion of patients with CNS involvement is considered to be relevant because it is a common\nmetastatic site for SCLC and is associated with exceptionally poor prognosis.\nThe final analysis demonstrated an independent review committee confirmed overall response rate of\n33.7% and median overall survival of 10.2 months in the patient population relevant to the authorised\nindication. These results are considered to be clinically meaningful in the context of the published\ndata for the current standard of care5. However, the major limitation of the pivotal study results\npresented is the lack of a randomised control arm.\nIn order to provide confirmatory evidence to support the conversion from a temporary authorisation to\na regular authorisation, the applicant commits to provide results from a Phase 3 Study PM1183-C-\n008-21, which directly compares lurbinectedin monotherapy or lurbinectedin combined with irinotecan\nversus either topotecan or irinotecan in post-platinum SCLC patients with CTFI \u226530 days.\nRegarding safety, the most frequent treatment emergent adverse events in the Study PM1183-B-005-\n14 SCLC cohort were fatigue, nausea, dyspnoea, constipation and decreased appetite. The most\ncommon grade \u22653 haematological toxicities were neutropenia, lymphopenia, leukopenia, anaemia\nand thrombocytopenia. The reported adverse drug reactions for lurbinectedin are consistent with\nother alkylating agents. Phase 3 Study PM1183-C-004-14 of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer\npatients, in which lurbinectedin was directly compared with topotecan, provided additional supportive\nevidence. In this study haematological adverse events were numerically less frequent and less severe\nin patients treated with lurbinectedin compared with topotecan. Grade \u22653 haematological toxicities, in\nparticular neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, were less frequent in patients treated with\nlurbinectedin compared with topotecan. Patients in the lurbinectedin arm also required less supportive\nmeasures compared with topotecan-treated patients.\nIn conclusion, the efficacy results for lurbinectedin are considered clinically meaningful in the context\nof published data for the current standard of care, especially considering the poor survival outcomes\nand the lack of therapeutic advancements for decades in the requested second-line SCLC indication5\n.\nSafety analyses of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients demonstrate a more favourable toxicity\nprofile for lurbinectedin compared with topotecan. The main weakness of the submitted dossier is the\nlack of direct comparison of lurbinectedin 3.2 mg/m2 every 3 weeks compared to topotecan in SCLC\npatients. Study PM1183-C-008-21 (LAGOON) will be required as confirmatory evidence for the\nconversion of a temporary to a regular marketing authorisation for the requested indication.",
        "summary": "Patients with SCLC have a poor chance of survival. Although those affected initially respond well to platinum-based chemotherapy, many SCLC patients suffer a relapse or progression of the disease. No progress has been made in second-line treatment for these patient groups in decades. The current standard second-line treatment is toxic. There is therefore a great medical need for other treatment options. Zepzelca has been authorised as an orphan drug. The term \"orphan drug\" is used to refer to important medicines for rare diseases.\nCompared with the published data for the current second-line treatment option, the results of the study submitted are considered to be clinically promising. The significance of the results is limited by the single-arm study and requires further confirmatory data from a controlled study.\nTaking all the risks and precautions into account, and based on the available data, the benefits of Zepzelca outweigh the risks. Swissmedic has authorised the medicinal product Zepzelca temporarily in Switzerland (in accordance with Art. 9a TPA) since not all clinical trials were available or had been concluded at the time of authorisation. The temporary authorisation is contingent on the timely submission of the data requested by Swissmedic. Once these authorisation conditions have been met, the temporary authorisation can be converted into an ordinary authorisation if the benefit-risk assessment of the results remains positive.",
